<p id="corty3e-pt3-review-p29" block_type="pr_que_nl"><phrase block_type="question_num">7.</phrase> A babysitter once told me that she thought regular babysitting was the best contraceptive in the world. She loved kids and planned to have several someday, but she realized how much responsibility they were and was not going to rush into it. I decided to conduct a study to see if babysitting had any impact on the age at which women had their first child. I found 10 women who had never babysat, 10 who babysat occasionally, and 10 who were frequent babysitters. All participants were college graduates. For each, I determined her age at the birth of her first child. The means for the three groups are: <em>never babysat</em> = 23.10 years old at birth of first child; <em>occasional</em> = 24.60; <em>frequent</em> = 26.90.</p>
