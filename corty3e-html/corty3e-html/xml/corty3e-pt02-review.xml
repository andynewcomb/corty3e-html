He is curious if caffeine, a stimulant, has an impact on ADHD symptoms. He takes a sample of children who have been diagnosed with ADHD but who are not on medication. One by one, he places each child in a chair to watch a very boring, 15-minute video. The chair has a sensor, so it can measure how many minutes a child remains seated&#8212;the fewer the minutes, the worse the child&#8217;s ADHD symptoms are. A few days later, each child returns to the researcher&#8217;s office, consumes 16 ounces of Starbucks coffee, and repeats the earlier procedure watching an equally boring video.
