<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch2-p15"><p>Frequency distributions can be made for nominal-, ordinal-, interval-, or ratio-level data. A frequency distribution is an intuitive way to organize and reduce data. A <span data-type="termref" data-term="frequency distribution">frequency distribution</span> is simply a count of how often the values of a variable occur in a set of data. For example, to tell someone how many boys and girls are in a class is to make a frequency distribution.</p></div>

<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="corty3e-ch2-sec2-1">Ungrouped vs. Grouped Frequency Distributions
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch2-p16"><p>There are two different types of frequency distribution tables, ungrouped and grouped. An <strong>ungrouped frequency distribution</strong> table is a count of how often each value of a variable occurs in a data set. In a <strong>grouped frequency distribution</strong> table, the frequency counts are for adjacent groupings of values, or intervals, of the variable.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p17"><p>Ungrouped frequency distributions are used when the values a variable can take are limited. For example, if students were surveyed about how many children were in their families, a limited number of responses would exist. Students would most commonly report that there were one, two, or three kids in their families. Almost no one would report ten or more kids. An ungrouped frequency distribution for data like these would be compact, taking up maybe a half-dozen lines on one page, and could be viewed easily.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_40"><p>40</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p18"><p>Now if the same students were surveyed about the size of their high school graduating classes, it would be a very different frequency distribution. The survey would yield answers ranging from 1 (homeschooled) to 500 or more students. If one listed each value separately, it would take many lines and could run to multiple pages. This would be hard to view and not a good summary of the data. In this case, it would make sense to group answers together in intervals (fewer than 100 in the class, 100 to 199 in the class, etc.) to make a more compact presentation.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p19"><p>Grouped frequency distributions should be used when the variable has a large number of values and it is acceptable to lose information by collapsing the values into intervals. If the variable has a large number of values but it is important to retain information about all the unique values, then one should use an ungrouped frequency distribution.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p20"><p><strong><span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch2-fig-1">Table 2.1</span></strong> shows both an ungrouped frequency distribution and a grouped frequency distribution for the binge drinking data from <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch01.xml">Chapter 1</span>. Note the size of the ungrouped frequency distribution and the many gaps in it. There is too much detail to get a clear picture of the data. Compare that to the compactness of the grouped frequency distribution, which reduces the data to a greater degree and does a better job summarizing and describing it.</p></div>

Percentages are a way of transforming scores to put them in context. To see how this works, imagine that a psychologist said that two of the clients he treated in the last year experienced major depression. Does he specialize in the treatment of depression? The answer depends on how many total clients he treated in the last year. If he offered therapy to four patients, then half of them, or 50%, were depressed. If he treated 100 cases, then only 2% were depressed. Whether the psychologist is a depression specialist depends on what percentage of his practice is devoted to treating that illness.

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch2-p51"><p>Ungrouped frequency distributions work well in two conditions: (1) when the variable takes a limited set of values, or (2) when one wants to document all the values a variable can take. If one were classifying semester status of students in college, there is a limited number of options (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) and an ungrouped frequency distribution would work well. There are many more options for the number of credit hours a student has completed, and an ungrouped frequency distribution for this variable would only make sense if it were important to keep track of how many students had 15 hours vs. 16 hours vs. 17 hours, and so forth.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p52"><p>When dealing with a variable that has a large range, like number of credit hours, a grouped frequency distribution makes more sense. In a grouped frequency distribution, one finds the frequency with which a variable occurs over a range of values. In the credit hours example, one might count how many students have completed from 0 to 14 hours, or from 15 to 29 hours, and so forth. These ranges are called intervals or bins and are abbreviated with a lowercase <em>i.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p53"><p>Grouped frequency distributions work best when there is an order to the values a variable can take, that is, when the variable is measured at the ordinal, interval, or ratio level. Nominal data can be grouped if there is some logical categorization. For example, imagine that a psychologist collected detailed information about the diagnoses of her patients—whether they had major depression, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, alcoholism, heroin addiction. These responses could be grouped into categories of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse disorders.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_45"><p>45</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p54"><p>For variables that are measured at the ordinal level or higher, the first step is to decide how many intervals to include in a grouped frequency distribution. There needs to be a balance between the amount of detail presented and the number of intervals. There shouldn’t be so few intervals that one can’t see important details in the data set, and there shouldn’t be so many intervals that the big picture is lost in the details. A rule of thumb is to use psychology’s magic number, 7 ± 2, and have from five to nine intervals. But, that’s just a rule of thumb—if fewer than five intervals or more than nine intervals do a better job of communication, that’s fine. The other thing to keep in mind is convention. It is common to make intervals that are 5, 10, 20, 25, or 100 units wide.</p></div>

These numbers represent the number of property crimes that occur in a state for every thousand people who live in that state. They are organized from low (17 crimes per 1,000) to high (44 crimes per 1,000) to make it easy to construct a grouped frequency distribution.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p56"><p>The first task is to decide how many intervals to include. One needs to have intervals that will capture all data and that don’t overlap. One option is to have 10-point-wide intervals—one for the values in the 10s, one for the 20s, the 30s, and the 40s. But that means only four intervals and so few intervals would lose too much detail. Instead, it makes sense here to opt for 5-point-wide intervals. Note that the first interval starts at 15, not 17, because starting an interval at a multiple of 5 is a convention commonly followed. The first interval is 15–19. (If you don’t believe it is five points wide, count it off on your fingers.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p57"><p>There’s one other thing to mention—all intervals should be the same width so that the frequency in one interval can be compared to the frequency in another.

<span data-type="number">Figure 2.7: </span><span data-type="caption"><strong><span data-block_type="fig_num">Figure 2.2</span> Four Cardinal Compass Headings</strong> This figure shows the degrees associated with the four main compass headings—north, east, south, and west—as well as the degrees halfway between them. Though a heading of east is exactly 90°, we would say a person is heading east anywhere from 45° to 135°. “East” is the midpoint of that interval.</span>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p59"><p>There are two reasons for having a midpoint. First, the midpoint is, in a sense, a summary of the interval. Imagine a compass drawn as a circle with only four headings—north, east, south, and west (see <strong><span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch2-fig-12">Figure 2.2</span></strong>). North is at the top, labeled 360°, east is to the right, labeled 90°, and so on. If Sharon were heading off to the right at exactly 90°, one would say that she was heading east. But when else would one say she was heading east? If the only options were to say a person was heading north, east, south, or west, one would say “east” when that person was heading anywhere from 45° to 135°. East is the midpoint of that interval <img id="" src="asset/ch2/corty3e_ineqn02_46_01.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image">, a summary of the direction for all the points in that interval.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p60"><p>There’s another reason for having a midpoint. Suppose a grouped frequency distribution, like that in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch2-fig-10">Table 2.5</span>, was the only information one had. There was no access to the original data. One would know that there are three cases in the 15–19 interval, but their specific values wouldn’t be known. Were they all 15s? All 19s? Spread throughout the interval? Statisticians have developed the convention that when the exact value for a case is unknown, it is assigned the value of the midpoint of the interval within which it falls.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-ex-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch2-p62"><p>For practice making a frequency distribution table, imagine a school district that wanted to get a better picture of the intelligence of its students. It hired a psychologist to administer IQ tests to a random sample of sixth-grade students. Now the district needs a summary of the results.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-ex-txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p63"><p><strong><span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch2-fig-15">Table 2.7</span></strong> shows the raw data for the students tested. The first thing to note is that there is a lot of data—four columns of 15 and one of 8, so <em>N</em> = 68. The second thing to note is that a wide range of IQ scores exists, from the 60s to the 150s. Given the wide range of scores and given that it doesn’t seem necessary to maintain information about all the unique scores, a grouped frequency distribution is a more sensible option than an ungrouped frequency distribution to summarize the data.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p64"><p>The first step in making a grouped frequency distribution is organizing the data. <strong><span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch2-fig-16">Table 2.8</span></strong> shows the data arranged in ascending order.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p65"><p>The next decision is how many intervals to have and/or how wide they should be. The range of scores is from 67 to 152. Grouping scores by tens into 60s, 70s, 80s, and so on seems like a reasonable approach. That would mean having 10 intervals, more than the five-to-nine-intervals rule of thumb suggests. But, it is not many more and having an interval width (10) that is familiar is important.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch2-p66"><p>Next, one needs to decide what information to put into the frequency distribution. The bare minimum is the interval and the frequency, but tables are more useful if they also include cumulative frequency, percentage, and cumulative percentage. <strong><span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch2-fig-17">Table 2.9</span></strong> shows a table, empty except for title, column labels, and interval information. Note that the intervals appear in the reverse order they did in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch2-fig-16">Table 2.8</span>. And, note that there are enough non-overlapping intervals so that each value falls in one, and only one, interval.</p></div>
