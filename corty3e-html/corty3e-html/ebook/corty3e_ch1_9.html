They are just as effective as metal handcuffs in terms of immobilizing someone who has been arrested and they are cheaper than metal handcuffs, but the police are concerned that the plastic ones might cause more abrasion to the skin of the wrist. The criminologist finds 20 volunteers, randomly divides them into two groups, cuffs one group with metal and the other with plastic, and then rides them around in a squad car for 20 minutes. After this, the criminologist measures the degree of abrasion on their wrists as the percentage of skin that is roughed up.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="cr-x-nl-txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p294"><p><span data-block_type="question_num">1.32</span> Some football players put streaks of black paint under their eyes because they believe that it helps them see better in sunny conditions and react more quickly. A sensory psychologist wants to see if this is really true. He gathers a group of volunteers and randomly divides them in two. Half get black paint applied under their eyes and half get flesh-color. The players are not allowed to look in the mirror, so they don’t know which color has been applied below their eyes. The psychologist then gives them a reaction time task to measure, in milliseconds, how quickly they can respond to a change in a stimulus while bright lights are being shined at them.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="cr-x-nl-txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p295"><p><span data-block_type="question_num">1.33</span> Ever notice that some college students buy all the books for class, complete all the readings, do all the homework, and so on? These students usually end up with better grades as well. An education professor decided to investigate if these more conscientious students received better grades because they worked harder or because they were innately smarter. The professor assembled (a) a group of conscientious students from a number of different colleges and (b) a group of nonconscientious students from the same colleges, and compared the two groups in terms of a standardized IQ test.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="cr-x-nl-txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p296"><p><span data-block_type="question_num">1.34</span> A personality psychologist has kindergarten teachers use an empathy scale that ranges from 0 (not at all empathetic) to 100 (extremely high levels of empathy) to rate their students.

She has parents classify their children as naughty or nice, then calculates how much the parents spent on Christmas presents for the two different groups of children.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="cr-x-nl-txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p299"><p><span data-block_type="question_num">1.37</span> A political scientist is curious as to what influences voting behavior on taxes for school districts. She obtains a sample of voters and divides them, randomly, into three groups. One group serves as the control group, nothing is done to them. To one experimental group, she gives information about the school taxes that focuses on the positive—how the levy will improve student performance, make the community more attractive to young families, and so on. To the other experimental group, she gives negative information about the school taxes—how much overall taxes will increase, how school taxes will take away funding from other projects, how wasteful the school district has been, and so on. She then measures, for each group, the percentage voting in favor of the school taxes.</p></div>
