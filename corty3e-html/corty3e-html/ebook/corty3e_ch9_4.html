<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p109"><p>Before Dr. Keim starts the interpretation, let’s review her study on the effect of humidity on perceived temperature. She used six participants in a within-subjects design, where each person was tested twice in a 76° room, once at low humidity and once at high humidity. The mean perceived temperature in the low-humidity condition was 75.00°F (<em>s</em> = 4.34°F) and 82.50°F (<em>s</em> = 4.93°F) in the high-humidity condition. The mean difference score was 7.50 (<em>s<sub>D</sub></em> = 2.07°F). For a two-tailed test with α = .05 and <em>df</em> = 5, <em>t<sub>cv</sub></em> was ±2.571°F. Dr. Keim calculated <img id="" src="asset/ch9/corty3e_ineqn09_302_01.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image"> = 0.85°F and <em>t</em> = 8.82°F.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch9-p110"><p>This first interpretation question can be answered by plugging the observed value of the test statistic, <em>t</em> = 8.82, into the decision rule Dr. Keim formulated in Step 4:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p113"><p>The first statement is true because 8.82 is greater than or equal to 2.571.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p114"><p>Rejecting the null hypothesis that the two population means are the same leads to accepting the alternative hypothesis that the two population means are different.

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch9-p115"><p>Reporting that there is a difference is true, but it is not very useful. The logical follow-up question is, “What is the direction of the difference?” By examining the two sample means, 75.00° for the low-humidity condition vs. 82.50° for the high-humidity condition, Dr. Keim can conclude that 76° feels significantly hotter with high humidity than with low humidity.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p116"><p>A researcher only needs to worry about the direction of the difference when the null hypothesis is rejected. If Dr. Keim had failed to reject the null hypothesis, then there would not have been enough evidence to conclude that a difference exists between the two means, so there would have been no reason to consider the direction of the difference.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch9-p125"><p>In the last two chapters, for the single-sample <em>t</em> test and the independent-samples <em>t</em> test, we calculated Cohen’s <em>d</em> and <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> in order to quantify how much impact the explanatory variable had on the outcome variable. It is possible to calculate Cohen’s <em>d</em> and <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> for a paired-samples <em>t</em> test, but doing so is <em>not</em> advisable.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p126"><p>The reason that these effect sizes are inappropriate for a paired-samples <em>t</em> test is that they measure more than just the impact of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable. Cohen’s <em>d</em> and <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> for a paired-samples <em>t</em> test also include the effect of individual differences. As a result, they overestimate the size of the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. For example, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> would be 94% for the humidity data if it were calculated. If true, it would mean that humidity status explains 94% of the variability in perceived temperature. That would be a huge effect for the explanatory variable of humidity level. Unfortunately, it is not true. Here’s why.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_306"><p>306</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p127"><p>Look at <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch09.xml#corty3e-ch9-fig-1">Table 9.1</span>, which presents the data for each case in each of the two conditions. Notice that there’s variability within a condition: not everyone perceives the temperature the same way. As everyone in a condition receives the same treatment, the variability within a condition results from individual differences among the participants. Look at case 6 who perceived the low-humidity condition as the coldest, 68°. Case 6 also gives the lowest rating of the temperature in the high-humidity condition. Case 6 differs from the other individuals in this study in that he or she always feels cold. Case 2, in contrast, differs in the perception of temperature, feeling the warmest in both conditions.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p128"><p>The type of participant, cold-sensitive or heat-sensitive, has a large effect on the temperature the environment is perceived to be. Whether a person is cold-sensitive or heat-sensitive is an individual differences variable. When <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> or Cohen’s <em>d</em> is calculated for a paired-samples <em>t</em> test, they mix in the impact of these individual differences on temperature <em>with</em> the impact of the different conditions (high vs. low humidity) on temperature. This means that they give an inflated effect size and are not appropriate to estimate effect size for a paired-samples <em>t</em> test.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p129"><p>So, how does a researcher measure effect size for a paired-samples <em>t</em> test? One way is to calculate the confidence interval for the difference between population means and then use professional expertise—and common sense—to translate it into an effect size. Another approach, not possible until <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch12.xml">Chapter 12</span>, is to use a test called the repeated-measures ANOVA instead of a paired-samples <em>t</em> test. The repeated-measures ANOVA, unlike the paired-samples <em>t</em> test, separates out the impact of individual differences from the effect of the explanatory variable, allowing the effect of the explanatory variable alone to be assessed.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p137"><p>Applying this to her humidity data, Dr. Keim would calculate the 95% confidence interval as follows:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="corty3e-ch9-p138"><p>95%CIµ<sub>Diff</sub> = (82.50 – 75.00) ± (2.571 × 0.85)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="corty3e-ch9-p139"><p>= 7.5000 ± 2.1854</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="corty3e-ch9-p140"><p>= from 5.3146 to 9.6854</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="corty3e-ch9-p141"><p>= [5.31, 9.69]</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch9-p142"><p>Her confidence interval ranges from a lower limit of 5.31° to an upper limit of 9.69°. To make the interpretation more accessible, Dr. Keim has rounded each end to a whole number, making the confidence interval range from 5 to 10 degrees. In interpreting this confidence interval, Dr. Keim will pay attention to three points: (1) whether the confidence interval captures zero, (2) how close it comes to zero, and (3) how wide it is.</p></div>
<ol data-block_type="numbered" id="corty3e-ch9-list-10">
<li><div data-block_type="nl-first" id="corty3e-ch9-p143"><p>If a confidence interval captures zero, this means it is possible that the difference between the means of the populations is zero. When such happens, it is plausible that the null hypothesis is true. (This assumes that the confidence interval and the alpha level of the hypothesis test are synchronized.)</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-mid" id="corty3e-ch9-p144"><p>How close the confidence interval comes to zero provides information about the effect size in the larger population. If both ends of the confidence interval are close to zero, then the effect size is probably small. If both ends of the confidence interval are far from zero, then the effect size is probably large. If one end of the confidence interval is close to zero and the other end is far away, then the researcher will be left unsure of how strong or weak the effect actually is in the population.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-last" id="corty3e-ch9-p145"><p>The width of the confidence interval provides information about how precisely the effect can be specified in the population. Narrower confidence intervals are preferred because they give a more precise sense of the size of the effect in the population. If the confidence interval is wide, the researcher will usually recommend replicating with a larger sample size in order to determine the parameter value more precisely.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p146"><p>For the humidity study, the confidence interval, from 5 to 10 degrees, does not capture zero. This is to be expected as the null hypothesis was rejected. The confidence interval reiterates what is already known—it is unlikely, in the larger population, that there is no difference in how 76° is perceived in low humidity vs. how it is perceived in high humidity. Instead, in the population, the high-humidity condition is probably perceived as 5–10 degrees hotter, on average, than the same temperature at low humidity.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p147"><p>The second step, determining how small and how large the effect may be, takes more thought and expertise for the paired-samples <em>t</em> test than it did for the independent-samples <em>t</em> test. With an independent-samples <em>t</em> test, the researcher could calculate Cohen’s <em>d</em> or <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> and rely on Cohen’s standards for small, medium, and large effects. The end of the confidence interval closer to zero (the lower limit) is 5 and the end farther away (the upper limit) is 10. In the larger population, will people perceive the temperature to be a lot hotter or a little hotter if they perceive 76° in conditions of high humidity as 5 degrees hotter than in low humidity? Dr. Keim believes this to be a meaningful effect. She reasons that, on a summer day, there is a noticeable difference in comfort level between being in an air-conditioned room at 71° and one at 76°, so a 5-degree difference is a meaningful one. If a 5-degree difference is meaningful, then a 10-degree difference is even more so. In understanding what a 10-degree difference means, Dr. Keim thinks of how a 76° summer day feels pleasant and an 86° day feels hot.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_308"><p>308</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p148"><p>Finally, she uses Equation 7.5 to calculate the width of the confidence interval. To avoid rounding error, she uses the real limits of the confidence interval, 5.31 to 9.69, not her rounded version of 5 to 10:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="corty3e-ch9-p149"><p>CI<em><sub>W</sub></em> = CI<em><sub>UL</sub></em> – CI<em><sub>LL</sub></em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="corty3e-ch9-p150"><p>= 9.69 – 5.31</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="corty3e-ch9-p151"><p>= 4.38</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch9-p152"><p>The confidence interval is 4.38° wide. This seems sufficiently narrow to Dr. Keim. She would like to replicate the study in order to make sure the same effect is observed again, and she would like to increase the sample size in order to have a better sample, but she feels no need to replicate with a larger sample size in order to narrow the confidence interval. Given that both a 5-degree difference and a 10-degree difference seem meaningful and that the confidence interval is narrow, Dr. Keim is inclined to focus on the observed difference of 7.50 degrees in her interpretation.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch9-p153"><p>Here is Dr. Keim’s four-point interpretation in which she states: (1) what the study was about; (2) the main results; (3) what the results mean; and (4) her suggestions for future research. This interpretation is a little longer than previous ones. It takes Dr. Keim two paragraphs to say all that she wants to.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt_v1" id="corty3e-ch9-p154"><p>The impact of humidity on perceived temperature was examined. Using a within-subjects design, six participants judged the temperature after being in a 76° room under conditions of low humidity and high humidity. In the low-humidity condition, they judged the temperature fairly accurately (<em>M</em> = 75.00°F), but they judged it as hotter (<em>M</em> = 82.50°F) under conditions of high humidity. This 7.50°F difference was statistically significant [<em>t</em> (5) = 8.82°F, <em>p</em> &lt; .05]. Humidity appears to make people feel hotter. According to this study, people feel almost 8 degrees hotter under conditions of high humidity. This is a noticeable increase in perceived temperature and can move a person from feeling comfortable to being uncomfortable.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt_v1" id="corty3e-ch9-p155"><p>There were several limitations to this study that can be rectified in future research. All participants were college students in the United States, people who have experience with heated and cooled environments. It would be interesting to see if the same effect were observed among people with less control over their indoor environments. A second limitation is that only one temperature, 76°, was tested. The effect of humidity on perceived temperature should be observed at both higher and lower temperatures. Finally, there were only six participants in this study. Replicating the study would increase confidence in the robustness of the finding that humidity level affects the perception of temperature.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_ni" id="corty3e-ch9-p171"><p>As expected, because Dr. Althof had failed to reject the null hypothesis, zero falls within this interval.

Based on this, Dr. Althof does not feel a great need to replicate the study with a larger sample size. Note, however, that the vast majority of the confidence interval falls on one side of zero. If the sample size had been larger and the confidence interval narrower, then it would have failed to capture zero and Dr. Althof would have rejected the null hypothesis. This makes him worry that a Type II error may have occurred. Perhaps there is a small effect that was not found. For this reason, Dr. Althof is going to suggest replicating with a larger sample size.</p></div>

This 4.77 percentage points higher rate among the men was statistically significant [<em>t</em>(9) = 7.57, <em>p</em> &lt; .05] and seems to show a reasonably strong effect of sex on the smoking rate. In the United States, men smoke at a higher rate. In future research, it would be interesting to see if the difference in rates between men and women has changed over time and to examine male/female differences in other countries.</p></div>

She took beginning students at her tennis camp and matched them in pairs in terms of their tennis abilities. She then randomly assigned the players to two conditions. Those in the control condition had to practice for half an hour every day with another player. Those in the experimental condition had to practice against a wall for half an hour every day. After two weeks of practice, the instructor measured how often each player could hit targets in different locations on the tennis court. The higher the percentage, the better the player had become.
