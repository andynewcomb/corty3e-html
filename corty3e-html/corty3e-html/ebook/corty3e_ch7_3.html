<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p131"><p>To some degree, interpretation is a subjective process. The researcher takes objective facts—like the means and the test statistic—and explains them in his or her own words. How one researcher interprets the results of a hypothesis test might differ from how another researcher interprets them. Reasonable people can disagree. But, there are guidelines that researchers need to follow. An interpretation needs to be supported by facts. One person may perceive a glass of water as half full and another as half empty, but they should agree that it contains roughly equal volumes of water and air.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p132"><p>Interpreting the results of a hypothesis test starts with questions to be answered. The answers will provide the material to be used in a written interpretation. For a single-sample <em>t</em> test, our three questions are:</p></div>

</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-last" id="corty3e-ch7-p135"><p>How wide is the confidence interval?</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p136"><p>The questions are sequential. Each one gives new information that is useful in understanding the results from a different perspective. Answering only the first question, as was done in the last chapter, will provide enough information for completing a basic interpretation. However, answering all three questions leads to a more nuanced understanding of the results and a better interpretation.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p137"><p>Let’s follow Dr. Farshad as she interprets the results of her study, question by question. But, first, let’s review what she did. Dr. Farshad wondered if adults with ADHD differed in reaction time from the general population. To test this, she obtained a random sample, from her state, of 141 adults who had been diagnosed with ADHD. She had each participant take a reaction time test and found the sample mean and sample standard deviation (<em>M</em> = 220 msec, <em>s</em> = 27 msec). She planned to use a single-sample <em>t</em> test to compare the sample mean to the population mean for adult Americans (μ = 200 msec).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p138"><p>Dr. Farshad’s hypotheses for the single-sample <em>t</em> test were nondirectional as she was testing whether adults with ADHD had faster or slower reaction times than the general population. She was willing to make a Type I error no more than 5% of the time, she was doing a two-tailed test, and she had 140 degrees of freedom, so the critical value of <em>t</em> was ±1.977. The first step in calculating <em>t</em> was to find the estimated standard error of the mean (<em>s<sub>M</sub></em> = 2.21) and she used that in order to go on and find <em>t</em> = 8.81.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="h3" id="corty-ch7-chead-1"><p>Was the Null Hypothesis Rejected?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p140"><p>In Dr. Farshad’s study, the <em>t</em> value was calculated as 8.81. Now it is time to decide whether the null hypothesis was rejected or not. To do so, Dr. Farshad puts the <em>t</em> value, 8.81, into the decision rule that was generated for the critical value of <em>t,</em> ±1.977, in Step 4. Which of the following statements is true?</p></div>
<ul data-block_type="bullet" id="corty3e-ch7-list-9">
<li><div data-block_type="bl-first" id="corty3e-ch7-p141"><p>Is 8.81 ≤ –1.977 <em>or</em> is 8.81 ≥ 1.977?</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="bl-last" id="corty3e-ch7-p142"><p>Is –1.977 &lt; 8.81 &lt; 1.977?</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p143"><p>The second part of the first statement is true: 8.81 is greater than or equal to 1.977. The observed value of <em>t,</em> 8.81, falls in the rare zone of the sampling distribution, so the null hypothesis is rejected (see <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch7-fig-15"><strong>Figure 7.6</strong></span>). She can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the sample mean of the adults with ADHD and the general population mean.</p></div>

</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p144"><p>Rejecting the null hypothesis means that Dr. Farshad has to accept the alternative hypothesis and conclude that the mean reaction time for adults with ADHD is <em>different</em> from the mean reaction time for the general population. Now she needs to determine the <em>direction</em> of the difference. By comparing the sample mean (220) to the population mean (200), she can conclude that adults with ADHD take a longer time to react and so have a <em>slower</em> reaction time than adults in general.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p145"><p>Dr. Farshad should also report the results in APA format. APA format provides five pieces of information: (1) what test was done, (2) the number of cases, (3) the value of the test statistic, (4) the alpha level used, and (5) whether the null hypothesis was or wasn’t rejected.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p152"><p>If Dr. Farshad stopped after answering only the first interpretation question, this is what she could write for an interpretation:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_231"><p>231</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p160"><p>All we know so far is that there is a statistically significant difference, such that we can conclude that adults with ADHD in Illinois have slower reaction times than the general American adult population does. We know there’s a 20-msec difference, but we are hard-pressed to know how much of a difference that really is.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p161"><p>Thus, the next question to address when interpreting the results is <span data-type="termref" data-term="effect size">effect size</span><strong>,</strong> how large the impact of the explanatory variable is on the outcome variable. With the reaction-time study, the explanatory variable is ADHD status (adults with ADHD vs. the general population) and the outcome variable is reaction time. Asking what the effect size is, is asking how much impact ADHD has on a person’s reaction time.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p162"><p>In this section, we cover two ways to measure effect size: Cohen’s <em>d</em> and <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>. Both can be used to determine if the effect is small, medium, or large. Both standardize the effect size, so outcome variables measured on different metrics can be compared. A 2-point change in GPA would be huge, while a 2-point change in total SAT score would be trivial. Both Cohen’s <em>d</em> and <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> take the unit of measurement into account. And, finally, both will be used as measures of effect size for other statistical tests in other chapters.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="h3" id="corty-ch7-chead-3"><p>Cohen’s <em>d</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p163"><p>The formula for <span data-type="termref" data-term="Cohens">Cohen’s <strong><em>d</em></strong></span> is shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch7-bx6-3">Equation 7.3</span>. It takes the difference between the two means and standardizes it by dividing it by the sample standard deviation.

The top panel (Small effect) shows what Cohen (1988) calls a small effect size (<em>d</em> = 0.20), the middle panel (Medium effect) a medium effect size (<em>d</em> = 0.50), and the bottom panel (Large effect) a large effect size (<em>d</em> = 0.80). These are mean differences, respectively, of 3, 7.5, and 12 IQ points. Notice how the differentiation between the two groups in each panel increases as the size of the effect increases, both in terms of increasing distance between the two means and decreasing overlap between the two distributions.</span>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p175"><p>Cohen describes a small effect as a <em>d</em> of around 0.20. This occurs when there is a small difference between means, a difference in performance that would not be readily apparent in casual observation. Look at the top panel in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch7-fig-18">Figure 7.7</span>. That’s what a small effect size looks like. Though the two groups differ by 3 points on intelligence (<em>M</em> = 100 vs. <em>M</em> = 103), it wouldn’t be obvious that one group is smarter than the other without using a sensitive measure like an IQ test (Cohen, 1988).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p176"><p>Another way to visualize the size of the effect is to consider how much overlap exists between the two groups. If the curve for one group fits exactly over the curve for the other, then the two groups are exactly the same and there is no effect. As the amount of overlap decreases, the effect size increases. For the small effect in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch7-fig-18">Figure 7.7</span>, about 85% of the total area overlaps.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p177"><p>A medium effect size, a Cohen’s <em>d</em> of around 0.50, is large enough to be observable, according to Cohen. Look at the middle panel in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch7-fig-18">Figure 7.7</span>. One group has a mean IQ of 100, and the other group has a mean IQ of 107.5, a 7.5 IQ point difference. Notice the amount of differentiation between groups for a medium effect size. In this example, about two-thirds of the total area overlaps, a decrease from the 85% overlap seen with a small effect size.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p178"><p>A large effect size is a Cohen’s <em>d</em> of 0.80 or larger. This is shown in the bottom panel of <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch7-fig-18">Figure 7.7</span>. One group has a mean IQ of 100, and the other group has a mean IQ of 112, a 12 IQ point difference. Here, there is a lot of differentiation between the two groups with only about half of the area overlapping. The increased differentiation can be seen in the large section of the control group that has IQs lower than the experimental group and the large section of the experimental group that has IQs higher than the control group.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p179"><p>The Cohen’s <em>d</em> calculated for the reaction-time study by Dr. Farshad was 0.74, which means it is a medium to large effect.

Now, for the single-sample <em>t</em> test, the confidence interval will be used to calculate the range for how big the difference is between two population means. Two populations? Dr. Farshad’s confidence interval, in the ADHD reaction-time study, will tell how large (or small) the mean difference in reaction time might be between the <em>population of adults with ADHD</em> and the general population of Americans.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p223"><p>What information does a confidence interval provide? The technical definition is that if one drew sample after sample and calculated a 95% confidence interval for each one, 95% of the confidence intervals would capture the population value. But, that’s not very useful as an interpretative statement. Two confidence interval experts have offered their thoughts on interpreting confidence intervals (Cumming and Finch, 2005). With a 95% confidence interval, one interpretation is that a researcher can be 95% confident that the population value falls within the interval. Another way of saying this is that the confidence interval gives a range of <em>plausible</em> values for the population value. That means it is possible, but unlikely, that the population value falls outside of the confidence interval. A final implication is that the ends of the confidence interval are reasonable estimates of how large or how small the population value is. The end of the confidence interval closer to zero can be taken as an estimate of how small the population value might be, while the end of the confidence interval further from zero estimates how large the population value might be.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p224"><p>Dr. Farshad’s confidence interval tells her that there’s a 95% chance that the difference between the two population means falls somewhere in the interval from 15.51 msec to 24.49 msec.

<li><div data-block_type="nl-first" id="corty3e-ch7-p226"><p>Does the confidence interval capture zero? The 95% confidence interval for the difference between population means gives the range within which it is likely that the actual difference between two population means lies. If the null hypothesis is rejected for a single-sample <em>t</em> test, the conclusion reached is that this sample probably did not come from that population; rather, that there are two populations with two different means. In such a situation, the difference between the two population means is not thought to be zero, and the confidence interval shouldn’t include zero. When the null hypothesis is rejected, the 95% confidence interval won’t capture zero. (This assumes that the researcher was using a two-tailed test with α = .05.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="nl_cont" id="corty3e-ch7-p227"><p>However, when a researcher fails to reject the null hypothesis, the confidence interval should include zero in its range. All that a zero falling in the range of the confidence interval means is that it is <em>possible</em> the difference between the two population means is zero. It doesn’t mean that the difference <em>is</em> zero, just that it may be. In a similar fashion, when one fails to reject the null hypothesis, the conclusion is that there isn’t enough evidence to say the null hypothesis is wrong. It may be right, it may be wrong; the researcher just can’t say.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p248"><p>A study compared the reaction time of a random sample of Illinois adults who had been diagnosed with ADHD (<em>M</em> = 220 msec) to the known reaction time for the American population (μ = 200 msec). The reaction time of adults with ADHD was statistically significantly slower than the reaction time found in the general population [<em>t</em>(140) = 8.81, <em>p</em> &lt; .05]. The size of the difference in the larger population probably ranges on this task from a 16- to a 24-msec decrement in performance. This is not a small difference—these results suggest that ADHD in adults is associated with a medium to large level of impairment on tasks that require fast reactions. If one were to replicate this study, it would be advisable to obtain a broader sample of adults with ADHD, not just limiting it to one state. This would increase the generalizability of the results.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p266"><p><em>How big is the effect?</em> Calculating an effect size like Cohen’s <em>d</em> or <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> when one has failed to reject the null hypothesis is a controversial topic in statistics. If one fails to reject the null hypothesis, not enough evidence exists to state there’s an effect. Some researchers say that there is no need to calculate an effect size if no evidence that an effect exists is found. Other researchers believe that examining the effect size when one has failed to reject the null hypothesis alerts the researcher to the possibility of a Type II error (Cohen, 1994; Wilkinson, 1999). (Remember, a Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis should be rejected, but it isn’t.) In this book, we’re going to side with calculating an effect size when one fails to reject the null hypothesis as doing so gives additional information useful in understanding the results.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p267"><p>In the pet-loss study, the mean GPA for the 11 students who had lost a pet was 2.58 (<em>s</em> = 0.50) and the population mean for all first-year students was 2.68.

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p269"><p>The effect size <em>d</em>, –0.20, is a small effect according to Cohen, while <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> of 4.30% would be classified as a small to medium effect. Why, when we fail to reject the null hypothesis, does there seem to be some effect? There are two explanations for this:</p></div>
<ol data-block_type="numbered" id="corty3e-ch7-list-18">
<li><div data-block_type="sr-exp-nl-first" id="corty3e-ch7-p270"><p>Even if the null hypothesis is true, in which case the size of the effect in the population is zero, it is possible, due to sampling error, that a nonzero effect would be observed in the sample. So, it shouldn’t be surprising to find a small effect.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_243"><p>243</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sr-exp-nl-last" id="corty3e-ch7-p271"><p>It is also possible that the observed effect size represents the size of the effect in the population. If this were true, it would mean a Type II error is being made.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p272"><p>When a researcher has concern about Type II error, he or she can suggest replication with a larger sample size. A larger sample size has a number of benefits. First, it makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis because a larger sample size, with more degrees of freedom, moves the rare zone closer to the midpoint. It is also easier to reject the null hypothesis because a larger sample makes the standard error of the mean smaller, which makes the <em>t</em> value larger. In fact, if the sample size had been 75 in the pet-loss study, not 11, <em>d</em> would still be –0.20, but the vet would have rejected the null hypothesis.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p273"><p>A statistician would call this study underpowered. To be <span data-type="termref" data-term="underpowered">underpowered</span> means that a study doesn’t include enough cases to have a reasonable chance of detecting an effect that exists. As was mentioned in <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch06.xml">Chapter 6</span>, if power is low, then beta, the chance of a Type II error, is high. So, raising a concern about one (Type II error) raises a concern about the other (power).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p274"><p><em>How wide is the confidence interval?</em> The final calculation Dr. Richman should make in order to understand his results is to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference between population means. This requires <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch7-bx6-5">Equation 7.5</span>:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-exp-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p275"><p>95% CIμ<sub>Diff</sub> = (<em>M</em> – μ) ± (<em>t<sub>cv</sub></em> × <em>s<sub>M</sub></em>)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-exp-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p278"><p>= from –0.4342 to 0.2342</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-exp-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p279"><p>= from –0.43 to 0.23</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p280"><p>Before interpreting this confidence interval, remember that the null hypothesis was not rejected and there is no evidence that pet loss has an effect on GPA. The confidence interval should show this, and it does.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p281"><p>This 95% confidence interval ranges from –0.43 to 0.23. First, note that it includes the value of 0. A value of 0 indicates no difference between the two population means and so it is a <em>possibility,</em> like the null hypothesis said, that there is no difference between the two populations. The confidence interval for the difference between population means should capture zero whenever the null hypothesis is not rejected. (This is true for a 95% confidence interval as long as the hypothesis test is two-tailed with α = .05.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p282"><p>Next, Dr. Richman looks at the upper and lower ends of the confidence interval, <span data-block_type="nowrap">–0.43</span> and 0.23. This confidence interval tells him that it is possible the average GPA for the population of students who have lost a pet could be as low as 0.43 points worse than the general student average, or as high as 0.23 points better than the general student average. This doesn’t provide much information about the effect of pet loss on academic performance—maybe it helps, maybe it hurts.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p283"><p>Finally, he looks at the width of the confidence interval using <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch7-bx6-6">Equation 7.6</span>:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-exp-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p284"><p><em>CI<sub>W</sub></em> = <em>CI<sub>UL</sub> – CI<sub>LL</sub></em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-exp-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p285"><p>= 0.23 – (–0.43)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p289"><p>The confidence interval is 0.66 points wide. This is a fairly wide confidence interval for a variable like GPA, a variable that has a maximum range of 4 points.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p290"><p>A confidence interval is better when it is narrower, because a narrower one gives a more precise estimate of the population value. How does a researcher narrow a confidence interval? By increasing sample size. Dr. Richman should recommend replicating with a larger sample size to get a better sense of what the effect of pet loss is in the larger population. Increasing the sample size also increases the power, making it more likely that an effect will be found statistically significant.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p291"><p><em>Putting it all together.</em> Here’s Dr. Richman’s interpretation. Note that (1) he starts with a brief explanation of the study, (2) reports some facts but doesn’t report everything he calculated, (3) gives his interpretation of the results, and (4) makes suggestions for improving the study.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p292"><p>This study explored whether losing a pet while at college had a negative impact on academic performance. The GPA of 11 students who lost a pet (<em>M</em> = 2.58) was compared to the GPA of the population of students at that college (μ = 2.68). The students who had lost a pet did not have GPAs that were statistically significantly lower [<em>t</em>(10) = –0.67, <em>p</em> &gt; .05 (one-tailed)].</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p293"><p>Though there was not sufficient evidence in this study to show that loss of a pet has a negative impact on college performance, the sample size was small and the study did not have enough power to find a small effect.

<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p304"><p>It is easier to count the number of chips in a single cookie than to count the number of chips in a whole bag of cookies. If a bag has at least 1,000 chips and there are 36 cookies in a bag, then each cookie should have an average of 27.78 chips. So, here is the challenge rephrased: “Chips Ahoy cookies are so full of chocolate chips that each one contains an average of 27.78 chips. We challenge you to count them.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_x_h4_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p305"><p><span data-block_type=" SR-X-h4-N-ri"><strong>Step 1</strong></span> This challenge calls for a statistical test. The population value is known: μ = 27.78. All that is left is to obtain a sample of cookies; find the sample mean, <em>M;</em> and see if there is a statistically significant difference between <em>M</em> and μ. Unfortunately, Nabisco has not reported σ, the population standard deviation, so the single-sample <em>z</em> test can’t be used. However, it is possible to calculate the standard deviation (<em>s</em>) from a sample, which means the single-sample <em>t</em> test can be used.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p306"><p>Ten cookies were taken from a bag of Chips Ahoy cookies. Each cookie was soaked in cold water, the cookie part washed away, and the chips counted. The cookies contained from 22 to 29 chips, with a mean of 26.10 and a standard deviation of 2.69.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_x_h4_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p307"><p><span data-block_type=" SR-X-h4-N-ri"><strong>Step 2</strong></span> The next step is to check the assumptions. The random sample assumption was violated as the sample was not a random sample from the population of Chips Ahoy cookies being manufactured. Perhaps the cookies being manufactured on the day this bag was produced were odd. Given the focus on quality control that a manufacturer like Nabisco maintains, this seems unlikely. So, though this assumption is violated, it still seems reasonable to generalize the results to the larger population of Chips Ahoy cookies.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p308"><p>We’ll operationalize the independence of observations assumption as most researchers do and consider it not violated as no case is in the sample twice and each cookie is assessed individually. Similarly, the normality assumption will be considered not violated under the belief that characteristics controlled by random processes are normally distributed.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_x_h4_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p309"><p><span data-block_type=" SR-X-h4-N-ri"><strong>Step 3</strong></span> The hypotheses should be formulated before any data are collected. It seems reasonable to do a nondirectional (two-tailed) test in order to allow for the possibilities of more chips than promised as well as fewer chips than promised. Here are the two hypotheses:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p310"><p><em>H</em><sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>Chips</sub> = 27.28</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p311"><p><em>H</em><sub>1</sub>: μ<sub>Chips</sub> ≠ 27.78</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_x_h4_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p312"><p><span data-block_type=" SR-X-h4-N-ri"><strong>Step 4</strong></span> The consequences of making a Type I error in this study are not catastrophic, so it seems reasonable to use the traditional alpha level of .05. As already decided, a two-tailed test is being used. Thus, the critical value of <em>t,</em> with 9 degrees of freedom, is ±2.262. Here is the decision rule:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p313"><p>If <em>t</em> ≤ –2.262 <em>or</em> if <em>t</em> ≥ 2.262, reject <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p314"><p>If –2.262 &lt; <em>t</em> &lt; 2.262, fail to reject <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_246"><p>246</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_x_h4_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p315"><p><span data-block_type=" SR-X-h4-N-ri"><strong>Step 5</strong></span> The first step in calculating a single-sample <em>t</em> test is to calculate what will be used as the denominator, the estimated standard error of the mean:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="equation" id="corty3e-ch7-eqn-12"><p>
<img id="" src="asset/ch7/corty3e_eqn07_246_01.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image"></p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p316"><p>The estimated standard error of the mean is then used to calculate the test statistic, <em>t:</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="equation" id="corty3e-ch7-eqn-13"><p>
<img id="" src="asset/ch7/corty3e_eqn07_246_02.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image"></p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_x_h4_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p317"><p><span data-block_type=" SR-X-h4-N-ri"><strong>Step 6</strong></span> The first step in interpreting the results is to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected. The second statement in the decision rule is true: –2.262 &lt; –1.98 &lt; 2.262, the null hypothesis is not rejected. The difference between 26.10, the mean number of chips found in the cookies, and 27.78, the number of chips expected per cookie, is not statistically significant. From this study, even though the cookies in the bag at <em>M</em> = 26.10 chips per cookie fell short of the expected 27.78 chips per cookie, not enough evidence exists to question Nabisco’s assertion that there are 27.78 chips per cookie and a thousand chips in every bag. And, there’s not enough evidence to suggest that, since 1997, Nabisco’s recipe has changed and/or its quality control has slipped.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p318"><p>Having answered the challenge, it is tempting to stop here. But forging ahead—going on to find Cohen’s <em>d</em>, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>, and the 95% confidence interval—will give additional information and help clarify the results.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p319"><p>Finding Cohen’s <em>d,</em> the size of the effect, provides a different perspective on the results:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="equation" id="corty3e-ch7-eqn-14"><p>
<img id="" src="asset/ch7/corty3e_eqn07_246_03.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image"></p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p320"><p>Though the <em>t</em> test says there is not enough evidence to find an effect, Cohen’s <em>d</em> says <em>d</em> = –0.62, a medium effect. This seems contradictory—is there an effect or isn’t there? Perhaps the study doesn’t have enough power and a Type II error is being made. This means that the study should be replicated with a larger sample size before concluding that Chips Ahoy hasn’t failed the thousand chip challenge. Calculating <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 30% leads to a similar conclusion.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p321"><p>Does the confidence interval tell a similar story? Here are the calculations for the confidence interval:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p322"><p>95% CIμ<sub>Diff</sub> = (<em>M</em> – μ) ± (<em>t<sub>cv</sub></em> × <em>s<sub>M</sub></em>)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p323"><p>= (26.10 – 27.78) ± (2.262 × 0.85)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p324"><p>= –1.6800 ± 1.9227</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p325"><p>= from –3.6027 to 0.2427</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p326"><p>= from –3.60 to 0.24</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_247"><p>247</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p327"><p>The confidence interval says that the range from –3.60 to 0.24 probably contains the difference between 27.78 (the expected number of chips per cookie) and the number really found in each cookie. As this range captures zero, it is possible that there is no difference, the null hypothesis is true, and bags of cookies really do contain 1,000 chips.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p328"><p>Positive numbers in the confidence interval suggest that the difference lies in the direction of there being more than 27.78 chips per cookie. Negative numbers suggest the difference is in the direction of there being fewer than 27.78 chips per cookie. Most of the confidence interval lies in negative territory. A betting person would wager that the difference is more likely to rest with bags containing fewer than a thousand chips.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p329"><p>The <em>t</em> test left open the possibility that Nabisco still ruled the 1,000 chip challenge. But, thanks to going beyond <em>t,</em> to calculating <em>d</em> and a confidence interval, it no longer seems clear that Nabisco would win the Chips Ahoy challenge.
