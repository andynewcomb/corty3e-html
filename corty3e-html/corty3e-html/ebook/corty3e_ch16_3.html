<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch16-p30"><p>Sometimes the objective is to describe a single case. If the characteristic being measured for an individual case is measured at the interval or ratio level, it can be left as a raw score or transformed. Transformed scores have an advantage because they put scores into context. This book covered two types of transformed scores in <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch04.xml">Chapter 4</span>:</p></div>

Graphs have a visual advantage over tables. Which graph can be used (histogram, frequency polygon, or bar graph) depends on whether the variable is continuous or discrete. <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch16-fig-6"><strong>Figure 16.4</strong></span> is a flowchart for determining if a variable is continuous or discrete.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p36"><p>A measure of central tendency for a variable is chosen depending on its level of measurement (see <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch16-fig-7"><strong>Table 16.3</strong></span>).

<li><div data-block_type="bl-first" id="corty3e-ch16-p37"><p>To describe central tendency in a sample for a variable measured at the interval or ratio level, the go-to option is the mean (<em>M</em> ).</p></div>

These statistics include the range, interquartile range (<em>IQR</em>), variance (<em>s</em> <sup>2</sup>), and standard deviation (<em>s</em>). The standard deviation is the most commonly used measure of variability. Different abbreviations are used for variance and standard deviation depending on whether one is referring to a population value or sample value. A lowercase Greek sigma, σ, is used for population standard deviations and <em>s</em> for sample standard deviations.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p41"><p>Just like seeing a mountain from several sides gives a better idea of what it looks like, using multiple perspectives—multiple descriptive statistics—gives a better sense of a set of data. Here are multiple ways a teacher might report how well her class had done on a test. Each descriptive statistic by itself answers a specific question. Taken together, they provide a detailed and comprehensive view of class performance:</p></div>
<ul data-block_type="bullet" id="corty3e-ch16-list-7">
<li><div data-block_type="bl-first" id="corty3e-ch16-p42"><p>The teacher might use a frequency distribution, grouping scores into A’s, B’s, and so on to provide an overview of the class performance.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-mid" id="corty3e-ch16-p43"><p>A single score like the mean would summarize the class’ performance, giving some sense of how easy (or difficult) the test was and how well (or how poorly) the class as a whole had done.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_624"><p>624</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-mid" id="corty3e-ch16-p44"><p>The standard deviation would indicate how much variability existed in the scores, how tightly they are packed around the mean.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-mid" id="corty3e-ch16-p45"><p>The range would tell how badly the worst student had performed and how well the best student had performed. It would also reveal how much distance separated the best and the worst students.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-last" id="corty3e-ch16-p46"><p>If a student came in to talk about his or her performance, the teacher might transform that student’s score into a percentile rank in order to compare that student’s performance to the rest of the class.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p47"><p>Sometimes the results from a sample are used to describe a population. The population standard deviation, σ, is an example of this. σ is a point estimate, a single value. <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch05.xml">Chapter 5</span> covered confidence intervals, which give a range within which it is likely that the population value falls. If one has a sample measured on an interval- or ratio-level variable and wants to estimate what the average value is in the larger population, a confidence interval for the mean is the way to go.</p></div>
