<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch12-p14"><p>More complex tools are needed to understand, to take apart, more complex things. A basic tool, like a rock, will get you into a skull and show you that there is grey soft matter in there. But, to see finer details of the brain, a saw and a scalpel are more helpful. As tools have evolved, think electron microscopes and MRI machines, so has our understanding of the brain.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p16"><p>Statistical tests are statisticians’ tools. Tests like a two-sample <em>t</em> test are simple tools—all they allow a user to do is compare two groups (e.g., What is the impact of 0 vs. 1 drink of alcohol on driving?). One-way ANOVA allows more groups to be compared at once, so it allows more complex questions to be addressed (How does 0 vs. 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 vs. 4 drinks affect driving?). But, the most complex ANOVA questions involve the influence of multiple factors at once (What is the impact on driving of different doses of alcohol for men vs. women, depending on the time elapsed since the last meal?)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p17"><p>A “factor” is ANOVA-speak for an explanatory variable, an independent variable or a grouping variable that is thought to have some impact on the dependent variable. Factorial ANOVA can have two, three, four, even five factors or “ways.” (The driving study had three: dose of alcohol, sex, and time since meal.) As the number of ways increases, a factorial ANOVA becomes harder to interpret. In this chapter, we’ll limit ourselves to two factors and what is called two-way ANOVA.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p18"><p>To introduce two-way ANOVA, here’s an example about the influence of two factors, nature <em>and</em> nurture, on personality. Suppose a researcher was studying factors that influence altruism and was interested in <em>both</em> how the children were reared (nurture) and what their nervous systems were like (nature). Using adopted children as participants, the researcher classified the children as falling into one of three levels—high, medium, or low—based on how altruistic their adoptive parents were. The adoptive parents reared them, so these three levels of altruism represented the influence of nurture. In addition, the researcher classified the children as being in one of two levels—high or low—based on how altruistic their birth parents were. Birth parents, who provide genetic material, represent the influence of nature. This two-way classification would allow the researcher to study the effect of both nature and nurture at the same time (see <strong><span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch12-fig-2">Table 12.2</span></strong>).</p></div>

(Note that it doesn’t matter which number goes first: It’s fine to call it a 3 × 2 ANOVA.) Each child in the study would be classified as fitting into only one of the six cells in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch12-fig-2">Table 12.2</span>. This design would allow the researcher to examine the influence of two factors on children’s altruism at once.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p21"><p>The type of two-way ANOVA being taught in this chapter is a <em>between-subjects</em> ANOVA. <span data-type="termref" data-term="Between-subjects">Between-subjects</span> is an ANOVA term for independent samples.

<div data-block_type="bx1-que" id="corty3e-ch12-p22"><p><strong>Q</strong> Can an ANOVA have more than two ways?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-ans" id="corty3e-ch12-p23"><p><strong>A</strong> Absolutely. There can be a three-way ANOVA, a four-way ANOVA, and even more ways than that. The general term for a multiple-way ANOVA is <span data-type="termref" data-term="factorial ANOVA">factorial ANOVA</span> (ways are also called <em>factors</em>). It is rare, however, that a researcher designs an experiment that needs more than a three-way ANOVA because the number of participants required becomes too large and the results become complicated to interpret.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p24"><p>There is an advantage to completing a single two-way ANOVA with two explanatory variables instead of two separate one-way tests, one for each of the explanatory variables. To explore this advantage, imagine a study that compares the final point total in a statistics class based on two explanatory variables: (1) type of instruction (whether students take the class in a classroom or online), and (2) level of math anxiety (whether students are high or low on math anxiety). Each factor has two levels (classroom vs. online, and high math anxiety vs. low math anxiety).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p25"><p>To conduct separate one-way tests, a researcher would need to do two separate studies:</p></div>
<ul data-block_type="bullet" id="corty3e-ch12-list-2">
<li><div data-block_type="bl-first" id="corty3e-ch12-p26"><p>To examine the effect of type of instruction, the researcher would get a sample of students, assign some to take the course in a classroom, others to take it online, and then compare how much they learned.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-last" id="corty3e-ch12-p27"><p>To examine the effect of anxiety, the researcher would put together another sample of students, classify them as high or low on math anxiety, have them all take the same course, and then compare how much they learned.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p28"><p>To conduct the study as a two-way ANOVA means examining both explanatory variables at once. The researcher would obtain <em>one</em> sample of students, classify them as high or low on math anxiety, and then assign half of each type to take the course in a classroom and half to take it online. That would give four groups:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p35"><p>There are two advantages to completing this study as a two-way ANOVA rather than as two one-way ANOVAs. First, it allows the study to be completed and analyzed in one pass, not as two different studies. Second, and more important, the person conducting the study gains more understanding because the variability in the dependent variable can now be divided into <em>three</em> effects. By doing the study as a two-way ANOVA, an effect has been gained.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p36"><p>The three effects being studied are:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_ni" id="corty3e-ch12-p72"><p>For practice with main effects and interaction effects, let’s look at some data on aggression in boys and girls. Suppose a developmental psychologist, Dr. O’Grady, administered an aggression scale to a random sample of 100 boys and 100 girls. Half of each sex had their level of physical aggression measured (getting into fights, throwing sticks and stones, etc.) and half had verbal aggression measured (spreading rumors, telling lies, etc.). On each scale, a higher score means more aggression.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p73"><p>Dr. O’Grady’s study compares the means for groups that differ on two independent variables, sex and type of aggression, so it is an example where results are analyzed with a two-way ANOVA. Each way has two levels, so this is called a 2 × 2 ANOVA and there are four cells. The results from Dr. O’Grady’s study can be found in <strong><span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch12-fig-14">Table 12.6</span></strong>, where each case fits in one, and only one, cell. For example, a boy who answered questions about physical aggressiveness would be in the top left cell.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p75"><p>The row means for boys (37.50) and girls (35.50) don’t show much of a main effect by sex. Boys are slightly more aggressive on average, but this 2-point difference could easily be due to sampling error. Even if the small difference indicated a difference between population means, it probably wouldn’t be a meaningful difference.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch12-p76"><p>The column means tell a similar story—the amount of physical aggression (<em>M</em> = 36) and the amount of verbal aggression (<em>M</em> = 37) are about equal. Verbal aggression is just slightly higher, but it seems possible that the levels of verbal aggression and physical aggression are the same in the populations and that the difference observed between the samples could easily be due to sampling error. Based on these column means, it seems that there is little difference in the use of the two types of aggression.</p></div>
