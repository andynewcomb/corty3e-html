<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch15-p313"><p>The <span data-type="termref" data-term="Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient">Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient</span> (abbreviated Spearman <em>r</em> or <em>r</em><sub>s</sub>) is the nonparametric version of the Pearson correlation coefficient. The Spearman <em>r</em> examines the relationship between (1) two ordinal-level variables, (2) one ordinal-level variable and one interval/ratio-level variable, or (3) as a fallback option with two interval/ratio-level variables when the assumptions for the Pearson <em>r</em> have been violated.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p314"><p>One can think of the Spearman <em>r</em> as a Pearson <em>r</em> in which the correlation is calculated for data that are converted to ranks. This means that a researcher can directly apply the hypothesis-testing steps about hypotheses, decision rules, calculation, and interpretation from the Pearson <em>r</em> to the Spearman <em>r</em>—as long as he or she remembers that ordinal, or ranked, data are being used.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p315"><p>For an example of how the Spearman <em>r</em> works, imagine a psychologist who examined the relationship between romantic attractiveness and academic success in high school students. His measure of romantic attractiveness was an interval scale that ranged from 0 (low) to 10 (high). Class rank, an ordinal measure, was the measure of academic success. He obtained both of these measures on a random sample of 24 seniors, and Panel A in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch15/corty3e_fig15_06a_b.html"><strong>Figure 15.6</strong></span> shows the relationship between them. It appears as if students who are doing less well academically are more romantically attractive.</p></div>

In the top graph (A), the naturally occurring range is used for each variable. In the bottom graph (B), the variables have been converted to ranks. For example, in Panel A, the <em>X</em>-axis ranges from 0 to 200, which is sufficient to capture the person with the highest class rank, 165. In Panel B, when the class ranks are ranked from 1 to 24, the person with a rank of 165 now has a score of 24 and the <em>X</em>-axis only has to go up to 25.</span>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p316"><p>Class rank is an ordinal-level variable, so a Pearson <em>r</em> is not appropriate to use to analyze these data. Instead, a Spearman <em>r</em> is the appropriate test. To conduct the Spearman <em>r,</em> each variable is assigned a rank from 1 to 24 and the rankings are correlated. Why is each variable assigned a rank from 1 to 24? Because there are 24 cases in the sample. The scatterplot for the ranked data is displayed in Panel B of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch15/corty3e_fig15_06a_b.html">Figure 15.6</span>, and it shows a very similar pattern to Panel A.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p317"><p>Look at class rank on the <em>X</em>-axis in the top panel of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch15/corty3e_fig15_06a_b.html">Figure 15.6</span>. For these 24 students, it ranges from 1 to 165 and the <em>X</em>-axis goes all the way up to 200 to accommodate this. Then look at the <em>X</em>-axis in the bottom panel—instead of ranging from 0 to 180, it ranges from 0 to 25. That’s because the Spearman <em>r</em> takes class rank, which was already an ordinal-level variable, and turns it into pure ranks. The student with the worst class rank in this sample, who had a class rank of 165, now has a score of 24, which indicates the worst class rank in the sample.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p318"><p>Similarly, the <em>Y</em>-axis variable, romantic attractiveness, is converted into ranks. In Panel A, the scores ranged from 0 to 10. In Panel B, when the scores are ranked, the highest possible score (for the most attractive person) is now 24, not 10.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p319"><p>The Spearman <em>r</em> is just like the Pearson <em>r,</em> except that it correlates ranks, not raw scores. The difference between the two can be seen in the axes of the two scatterplots in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch15/corty3e_fig15_06a_b.html">Figure 15.6</span>. In addition, look closely at the shape of the two scatterplots in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch15/corty3e_fig15_06a_b.html">Figure 15.6</span>—they are similar, but not exactly the same. Converting raw scores to ranks can change the shape. Sometimes, as here, it makes the relationship appear stronger. Other times it makes the relationship appear weaker. However, making the relationship stronger or weaker isn’t the objective. The objective is to use the appropriate statistical test for the data. If correlating two ordinal variables, one ordinal variable with one interval or ratio variable, or two interval and/or ratio variables where it’s not possible to proceed with a Pearson <em>r,</em> then the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient is the appropriate test.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch15-p320"><p><span data-type="termref" data-term="Mann-Whitney U test">The Mann–Whitney <em>U</em> test</span> is the nonparametric equivalent of the independent-samples <em>t</em> test. It is used to compare two independent populations when the dependent variable is measured at the ordinal level, or as a fallback test when nonrobust assumptions for an independent-samples <em>t</em> test have been violated. Because it uses an ordinal outcome variable, the Mann–Whitney <em>U</em> test determines if the median of one population is significantly different from the other.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p321"><p>The Mann–Whitney <em>U</em> works by combining the two independent samples and then assigning a rank to each case based on its standing in the pooled group. The two samples are then separated, and the sum of the ranks for each of the samples is calculated and used to calculate <em>U.</em> If the two populations have similar scores on the dependent variable, then each sample will have a mixture of high ranks and low ranks. However, if the two populations differ, then one will have more high ranks than the other. When this happens, the <em>U</em> value will reflect the difference in ranks between the samples, and the null hypothesis of no difference in the medians will be rejected.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p322"><p>Here’s an example where the difference between the two samples is very obvious. <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch15-fig-42"><strong>Table 15.13</strong></span> shows the speeds, in miles per hour, of the five fastest tennis serves by men and the five fastest serves by women.

Ranks 1 to 5 belong to the men and ranks 6 through 10 to the women. The sum of the men’s ranks, 15, and the sum of the women’s ranks, 40, are very different numbers. And, the <em>U</em> value that the Mann–Whitney <em>U</em> test would calculate for these data would reflect as much.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p324"><p>That’s how the Mann–Whitney <em>U</em> test works. It combines the two samples into one group, assigns ranks to the whole group, then puts the cases back into their original samples, and compares the ranks. If the ranks are evenly distributed between the two samples, then there is no evidence that the populations differ. But if one sample has a lot of high ranks and the other a lot of low ranks, then the difference between the populations is statistically significant.</p></div>

Surgery was then performed and the researchers followed the patients for three years to see how many lived and how many died (Morgan et al., 2011).</p></div>

Three years after surgery, 41% of the malnourished patients had died compared to only 14% of the patients who were not malnourished. This almost threefold increase in mortality was a statistically significant difference [χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <em>N</em> = 369) = 28.63, <em>p</em> &lt; .05]. The effect seems to be a strong one. For kidney cancer patients undergoing surgery, being malnourished prior to surgery is associated with almost a threefold increase in the risk of dying in the next three years. In future studies, it would be important to assess the reason for the malnourishment. If it resulted from having a more aggressive form of cancer, it might be the cancer, not the malnourishment, that led to the increase in mortality.</p></div>

Then go to a grocery store during the day and put a tally mark in Cell A for every woman you see shopping with children. A mark goes in Cell B for every woman shopping by herself. Similarly, use Cell C to keep track of men shopping with children and D for men shopping alone.</p></div>

Use a chi-square goodness-of-fit test with expected percentages of 50% and 50% to see if men and women share shopping responsibility equally. Do the results say something about contemporary gender roles?</p></div>
