<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch6-p161"><p>Imagine a study in which a clinical psychologist, Dr. Cipriani, is investigating if a new treatment for depression works. One way that her study would be successful is if the treatment were an effective one and the data she collected showed that. But, her study would also be successful if the treatment did not help depression and her data showed that outcome.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p162"><p>Those are “good” outcomes; there are also two “bad” outcomes. Suppose the treatment really is an effective one, but her sample does not show this. As a result of such an outcome, this effective treatment for depression might never be “discovered.” Another bad outcome would occur if the treatment were in reality an ineffective one, but for some odd reason it worked on her subjects. As a result, this ineffective treatment would be offered to people who are depressed and they would not get better.</p></div>

The two columns represent the reality in the population. The column on the left says the null hypothesis is really true. In Dr. Cipriani’s terminology, this means treatment has no impact. The column on the right says the treatment does make a difference; the null hypothesis is not true. The two rows represent the conclusions based on the sample. The top row says that the results fell in the common zone, meaning that the researcher will fail to reject the null hypothesis. (Dr. Cipriani will conclude that her new treatment does not work.) The bottom row says that the results fell in the rare zone, so the researcher will reject the null hypothesis. (Dr. Cipriani will conclude that her treatment works.)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p164"><p>The two scenarios in which a study would be considered a success are Outcome A and Outcome D. In Outcome A, in the terminology of hypothesis testing, a researcher correctly fails to reject the null hypothesis. For Dr. Cipriani, this outcome means that treatment is ineffective and the evidence of her sample supports this. In Outcome D, the null hypothesis is correctly rejected. For Dr. Cipriani, the treatment does work and she finds evidence that it does.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p165"><p>The two other outcomes, Outcome B and Outcome C, are bad outcomes for a hypothesis test because the conclusions would be wrong. In Outcome B, the researcher fails to reject the null hypothesis when it should be rejected. If this happened to Dr. Cipriani, she would say that there is insufficient evidence to indicate the treatment works and she would be wrong as the treatment really does work. In Outcome C, a researcher erroneously rejects the null hypothesis. If Dr. Cipriani concluded that treatment works, but it really doesn’t, she would have erroneously rejected the null hypothesis.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p166"><p>A problem with hypothesis testing is that because the decision relies on probability, a researcher can’t be sure if the conclusion about the null hypothesis is right (Outcomes A or D) or wrong (Outcomes B or C). Luckily, a researcher can calculate the probability that the conclusion is in error and know how <em>probable</em> it is that the conclusion is true. With hypothesis testing, one can’t be sure the conclusion is true, but one can have a known degree of certainty.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p169"><p>Routinely, researchers decide they are willing to make a Type I error 5% of the time. Five percent is an arbitrarily chosen value, but over the years it has become the standard value. One doesn’t need to use 5%. If the consequences of making a Type I error seem particularly costly, one might be willing only to risk a 1% chance of this mistake. For example, imagine using a test to select technicians for a nuclear power plant. The potential catastrophe if the wrong person is hired is so great that the cut-off score on the test should be very high. On the other hand, if making a Type I error doesn’t seem consequential—for example, if one is hiring people for a task that doesn’t have serious consequences for failure—then one might be willing to live with a greater chance of this error.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p172"><p>Making errors is never a good idea, so why isn’t alpha always set at .01 or even lower? The reason is simple. When alpha is set low, it is more difficult to reject the null hypothesis because the rare zone is smaller. Rejecting the null hypothesis is almost always the goal of a research study, so researchers would be working against themselves if they made it too hard to reject the null hypothesis. When setting an alpha level, a researcher tries to balance two competing objectives: (1) avoiding Type I error and (2) being able to reject the null hypothesis. The more likely one is to avoid Type I error, the less likely one is to reject the null hypothesis. The solution is a compromise. Setting alpha at .05 gives a modest chance of Type I error and a reasonable chance of being able to reject the null hypothesis.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p176"><p>In that study, Dr. Levine studied a sample of 81 people whom a psychic believed had abnormal blood pressure. Their mean blood pressure was 127.

The critical value of <em>z</em> was ±1.96. After calculating σ<em><sub>M</sub></em> = 2.00, he calculated <em>z</em> = 1.50. As <em>z</em> fell in the common zone, he failed to reject the null hypothesis. There was insufficient evidence to say that the psychic could discern people with abnormal blood pressure.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch6-p204"><p>To see hypothesis testing in action, let’s leave numbers behind and turn to a simplified version of one way the sex of a baby is identified before it is born. Around the fifth month of pregnancy, an ultrasound can be used to identify whether a fetus is a boy or a girl. The test relies on hypothesis testing to decide “boy” or “girl,” and it is not 100% accurate. Both Type I errors and Type II errors are made. Here’s how it works.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p205"><p>The null hypothesis, which is set up to be rejected, says that the fetus is a girl. Null hypotheses state a negative, and the negative statement here is that the fetus has no penis. Together, the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis have to be all-inclusive and mutually exclusive, so the alternative hypothesis is that the fetus has a penis.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p206"><p>The sonographer, then, starts with the hypothesis that the fetus is a girl. If the sonographer sees a penis, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted, that the fetus is a boy.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_207"><p>207</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p207"><p>Of course, mistakes are made. Suppose the fetus is a girl and a bit of her umbilical cord is artfully arranged so that it masquerades as a penis. The sonographer would say “Boy” and be wrong. This is a Type I error, where the null hypothesis is wrongly rejected.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p208"><p>A Type II error can be made as well. Suppose the fetus is a shy boy who arranges his legs or hands to block the view. The sonographer doesn’t get a clear view of the area, says “Girl,” and would be wrong. This is a Type II error, wrongly failing to reject the null hypothesis.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p209"><p>However, in this case, a smart sonographer doesn’t say “Girl.” Instead, the sonographer, failing to see male genitalia, indicates that there’s not enough evidence to conclude the fetus is a boy. That is, there’s not enough evidence to reject the hypothesis that it’s a girl. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx4-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch6-p210"><p>Grab a handful of coins, say, 25, and let’s investigate Type I error. Type I error occurs when one erroneously rejects the null hypothesis. In this exercise, the null hypothesis is going to be that a coin is a fair coin. This means that each coin has a heads and a tails, and there is a 50-50 chance on each toss that a heads will turn up.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p211"><p>For each coin in your handful, you will determine if it is a fair coin by tossing it, by observing its behavior. Imagine you toss the coin once and it turns out to be heads. Does that give you any information whether it is a fair coin or not? No, it doesn’t. A fair coin could certainly turn up heads on the first toss. So, you toss it again and again it turns up heads. Could a fair coin turn up heads 2 times in a row? Yes. There are four outcomes (HH, HT, TH, and TT), one of which is two heads, so two heads in a row should happen 25% of the time. How about three heads in a row? That will happen 12.5% of the time with a fair coin. Four heads? 6.25% of the time. Finally, if there are five heads in a row, we will step over the 5% rule. Five heads in a row, or five tails in a row, will happen only 3.125% of the time with a fair coin. It could happen, but it is a rare event, and when a rare event occurs—one that is unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis is true—we reject the null hypothesis.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p212"><p>So, here’s what you do. Test one coin at a time from your handful. Toss each coin 5 times in a row. If the result is a mixture of heads and tails, which is what you’d expect if the test were fair, there is not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. But, if it turns up five heads in a row or five tails in a row, you have to reject the null hypothesis and conclude the coin is not fair. If that happens to you, then pick up the coin and examine it. Does it have a heads and a tails? Toss it 5 more times. Did it turn up five heads or five tails again? This time, it probably behaved more like a fair coin.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p213"><p>There are two lessons here. First, occasionally, about 3% of the time, a fair coin will turn up heads 5 times in a row. If that happens, by the rules of hypothesis testing, we would declare the coin unfair. That conclusion would be wrong; it would be a Type I error. If you stopped there, if you did not replicate the experiment, you’d never know that you made a mistake. And that is a danger of hypothesis testing—your conclusion can be wrong and you don’t know it. So here’s the second lesson: replicate. When the same results occur 2 times in a row, you have a lot more faith in them.</p></div>
