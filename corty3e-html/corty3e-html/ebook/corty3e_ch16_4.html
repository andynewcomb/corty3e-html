</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch16-p61"><p>Let’s move from selecting the correct descriptive statistic to selecting the right difference test. Difference tests are the most popular type of hypothesis test used in psychology. <em>t</em> tests and ANOVAs are examples of difference tests. <span data-type="termref" data-term="Difference tests">Difference tests</span> are used when cases are sorted into groups that are defined on the basis of an explanatory variable. They are used to answer the question of whether groups differ on some outcome variable. For example, whether people with depression or people with anxiety are more impaired by their disorder would be answered by a difference test.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p62"><p>Difference tests are the go-to tests for experimental and quasi-experimental designs. In experimental designs, the researcher controls the assignment of participants to groups on the basis of the independent variable. With quasi-experimental designs, participants are classified as being in groups on the basis of their naturally occurring status on the grouping variable. In either event, a difference test is used to compare the groups in terms of the dependent variable.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p63"><p>The flowchart in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch16-fig-8"><strong>Figure 16.5</strong></span> shows how to choose the correct difference test to answer a research question. Picking the right test depends on (1) the number of groups of cases, (2) the number of explanatory variables, (3) the type of samples—independent or dependent, and (4) the level of measurement for the dependent variable.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p64"><p>Whether a study is experimental or quasi-experimental, the first decision point involves how many groups of cases there are: one, two, or three or more groups. If just one group exists, then the sample is being compared to a specified value or a population value. The specific test to be used in making that comparison is determined by the dependent variable’s level of measurement.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p65"><p>If there is more than one group, it is important to determine whether the comparison is between just two groups or among three or more groups. This determination leads to the next decision point. When the comparison is between two groups, the next decision point is whether the groups are independent samples or dependent samples (see <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch08.xml">Chapters 8</span> and <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch09.xml">9</span> on <em>t</em> tests).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p66"><p><span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch16-fig-9"><strong>Table 16.4</strong></span> presents guidelines for determining the type of samples—independent or dependent. Once the type of samples has been determined for a two-sample test, the specific difference test to use depends on the level of measurement for the dependent variable.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p67"><p>When there are three or more samples, the flowchart branches out depending on (1) the number of explanatory variables, (2) whether the samples are independent or dependent, and (3) the dependent variable’s level of measurement.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p68"><p>To see how the flowchart works, imagine a clinical psychologist who wanted to see how the loss of a parent before age 6 affected a child’s adult level of psychological functioning. She obtained a large and representative sample of adults and classified them as belonging to one of four groups: (1) neither parent had died before the child, who is now an adult, was 6 years old; (2) the mother died before the child was 6 years old; (3) the father died before the child was 6 years old; or (4) both parents died before the child was 6 years old. To measure adult psychological functioning, she used an interval-level measure of psychological resilience. What statistical test should she use to find out if the mean level of psychological resilience differs among these four groups? The difference test flowchart, <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch16-fig-8">Figure 16.5</span>, will help determine the answer.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="bl-first" id="corty3e-ch16-p69"><p>The first decision point involves how many groups of cases exist. There was one sample of cases, which was divided into four groups, so proceed down the flowchart path on the far right side for three or more groups.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-mid" id="corty3e-ch16-p70"><p>The next decision point involves how many explanatory variables exist. In this situation, there is one grouping variable, early parental death, that has four levels (none died, mother died, father died, both died).</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-mid" id="corty3e-ch16-p71"><p>The next choice point involves the type of samples, dependent or independent. In this example, each case is classified as belonging to only one group and cases are not paired with each other. Who is classified as being in one group has no impact on who is classified as being in one of the other groups. The samples are independent.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-last" id="corty3e-ch16-p72"><p>The final question to be addressed involves the level of measurement of the dependent variable. The dependent variable, psychological resilience, is measured at the interval level, which leads to the selection of a between-subjects, one-way ANOVA as the appropriate statistical test.</p></div>

From around the United States, he obtained a sample of families with two (and only two) children in which both children had attended college. His dependent variable was how much money the parents contributed to each child’s college education. Is there a difference in mean parental funding for first-born vs. second-born children?</p></div>
