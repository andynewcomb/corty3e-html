</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch15-p22"><p>The <span data-type="termref" data-term="chi-square goodness-of-fit test">chi-square goodness-of-fit test</span> is a nonparametric, single-sample test that can be used with a nominal dependent variable or a higher-level variable treated as categorical, such as turning actual scores on an exam into letter grades. This type of test is called a <span data-type="termref" data-term="single-sample test">single-sample test</span> because it compares the results from a single sample to a specific value, usually a population value. The chi-square goodness-of-fit test is the nonparametric version of the single-sample <em>z</em> test and single-sample <em>t</em> test.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p23"><p>Here’s an example of how the chi-square goodness-of-fit test might be used. Suppose a university administrator wants to survey a sample of students to get their opinion about a planned decrease in the intramural sports program. The administrator wants to make sure that the sample represents the university population, particularly in terms of gender. His sample is 59% female. From the registrar, he learns that 52% of the students at the university are female. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test could be used to compare the percentage of women in the sample to the percentage of women in the population. This allows the researcher to determine if obtaining a sample that is 59% female is a common occurrence if the population is 52% female. If it is a common occurrence, then he’ll decide that the sample may be representative of the population on this variable and he’ll be more likely to trust the results. If it is an uncommon occurrence, then the sample may be an odd one and its results unrepresentative.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p24"><p>To learn how to calculate and interpret the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, imagine this example from a small community where teenagers believe that the local police single them out more often than adult drivers for traffic stops. To investigate this, a traffic researcher, Dr. Koenig, randomly selected 72 tickets from all the tickets issued during a calendar year. As the age of the driver was recorded on each ticket, Dr. Koenig determined that 11 of the tickets went to teen drivers and 61 went to adults. The results are displayed in two cells, shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch15-fig-1"><strong>Table 15.1</strong></span>.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p25"><p>Teenagers received 11 of the 72 traffic tickets (15.28%) in the sample. Dr. Koenig found, from the Department of Motor Vehicles, that 8% of licensed drivers in the population of the town are teenagers. She reasoned that if teens were treated the same as adults, 8% of the traffic tickets should go to teens. Yet, the teens received more than 15% of the tickets. Do teens get more than their fair share of traffic tickets? Or, can the difference between what is expected (8%) and what is observed (15.28%) be explained by sampling error?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="h4" id="corty3e-ch15-p26"><p><span data-block_type="h4-n-ri"><strong>Step 1</strong></span> <strong>Pick a Test</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch15-p27"><p>This scenario calls for a single-sample test because a sample value, 15.28%, is being compared to a specific value, 8%. It may seem as if there are two samples (a sample of teens and a sample of adults), but it is just one sample (a sample of ticketed drivers) where the age status of each case is being measured (teen or adult) as the outcome variable. The outcome variable (the category of who gets a ticket, teen or adult) is a nominal-level variable, so the appropriate test is a chi-square goodness-of-fit test. Goodness-of-fit is abbreviated GOF.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="h4" id="corty3e-ch15-p28"><p><span data-block_type="h4-n-ri"><strong>Step 2</strong></span> <strong>Check the Assumptions</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch15-p29"><p>The chi-square goodness-of-fit test has three assumptions:</p></div>
<ol data-block_type="numbered" id="corty3e-ch15-list-3">
<li><div data-block_type="nl-first" id="corty3e-ch15-p30"><p><em>Random sample</em>. The sample should be a random sample from the population. This is a robust assumption, so it can be—and usually is—violated. As with parametric tests, if the random sample assumption is violated, then the researcher needs to be careful about generalizing the results from the sample. For the ticket data, there is a random sample of tickets, so the first assumption is not violated. But, the sample is only from tickets given in this town, so generalizability is limited.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-mid" id="corty3e-ch15-p31"><p><em>Independence of observations</em>. The cases in the sample should be independent of each other. This means that the observations don’t influence each other. This assumption is not robust, so one can’t proceed with the planned test if it is violated. With the ticket data, random sampling was used, so the cases within the sample aren’t connected to each other. In addition, no case was in the sample more than once. The independence of observations assumption is not violated.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-last" id="corty3e-ch15-p32"><p><em>Expected frequencies</em>. In order to conduct a chi-square test, all cells must have expected frequencies of at least 5. The chi-square test only works if there are enough cases in each cell. We will cover the method for calculating expected frequencies later in this chapter. Just know that the expected frequencies assumption is not robust, so the chi-square can’t be calculated if each cell doesn’t have enough cases. (For this example, expected frequencies will be large enough and this assumption isn’t violated.)</p></div>

But, as sampling error exists, one shouldn’t expect the sample to match the specified values exactly.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-mid" id="corty3e-ch15-p36"><p>The alternative hypothesis says that the distribution of the characteristic in the population is different from the specified values.

Teenage drivers in this town get more than their fair share of traffic tickets, almost twice as many as expected. Future research should extend the study to other municipalities.

Courtney had not done well in intro psych and tried to make the case that the instructor, Dr. Wald, was an unfairly harsh grader.

Courtney then found out, from the registrar, the percentages of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and F’s given in all other sections of intro psych that semester. In this table, D’s and F’s are combined into one category for reasons that will be explained shortly. This distribution, the information from the registrar, is shown in gray in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch15-fig-13"><strong>Figure 15.2</strong></span>.

A chi-square goodness-of-fit test addresses this question. Here, letter grades, which are ordinal, are treated as categorical.

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_nl" id="corty3e-ch15-p112"><p>The ideal scenario, from an experimenter’s standpoint, would be that students indicate a desire to take intro psych and then are randomly assigned to sections. But, of course, that didn’t happen, so the random samples assumption is violated. The objective of the assumption, though, is to study a sample that is representative of the population. When the random samples assumption is violated, a researcher can proceed with the study if he or she makes the case that the sample is representative. As there was nothing unusual about his two sections, Dr. Wald is willing to continue with the chi-square goodness-of-fit test.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p137"><p>The second statement is true: 6.76 is less than 7.815. As seen in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch15-fig-19"><strong>Figure 15.3</strong></span>, the observed value of chi-square, 6.76, falls in the common zone. Dr. Wald has failed to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the percentages of different grades in the population differ from what was indicated by the null hypothesis. With a sample size of 84, the discrepancy of the observed frequencies from the expected frequencies was small enough that sampling error could account for it. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that Dr. Wald grades more harshly than do the other intro psych faculty.</p></div>

Comparing an Observed Chi-Square Value to the Expected Distribution of Chi-Square Values</strong> The observed chi-square value, 6.76, falls in the common zone, meaning insufficient evidence exists to justify rejecting the null hypothesis.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p138"><p>The results in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch15-fig-13">Figure 15.2</span> show C’s, and D’s and F’s, turning up more often in Dr. Wald’s grades than among the grades of the other instructors. So, it may not seem correct to conclude that insufficient evidence exists to say that Dr. Wald gives more low grades. However, remember that hypothesis testing works like the American legal system: finding a defendant not guilty is different from saying the defendant is innocent. Saying that the evidence is insufficient is not the same as saying Dr. Wald gives the same grades as the other instructors.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch15-p147"><p>Here is a four-point interpretation for these results:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch15-p148"><p>A psychology professor gave more C’s, D’s, and F’s than the other instructors. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to see if he was a harsher grader than the others. The results showed that his grade distribution was not statistically different [<em>X</em><sup>2</sup> (3, <em>N</em> = 84) = 6.76, <em>p</em> &gt; .05]. This means there is not enough evidence to say that this professor grades differently from the other instructors. If one were to replicate this study, it would be desirable to use a larger sample and to measure characteristics like sex and GPA in order to make sure that the students in his classes are similar to students in the other classes.</p></div>
