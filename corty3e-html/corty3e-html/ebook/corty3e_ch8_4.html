<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch8-p137"><p>The null and alternative hypotheses are set up to be all-inclusive and mutually exclusive.

With a one-tailed test, as this one is, if the null hypothesis is rejected, then the direction of the difference between the populations is known.

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch8-p172"><p>To determine the impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable in the population, a confidence interval is used. For an independent-samples <em>t</em> test, a researcher calculates a confidence interval for the difference between population means, the same type of confidence interval calculated for the single-sample <em>t</em> test. This confidence interval estimates how close together (or how far apart) the two population means may be. This tells how much of an effect may, or may not, exist in the population.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p173"><p>Though any level of confidence, from greater than 0% to less than 100%, can be used for a confidence interval, the most commonly calculated is a 95% confidence interval.

In APA format, it would be written as 95% CI [3.32, 6.28]. This confidence interval tells what the effect of the type of processing is on recall in the larger population. It says that the effect probably falls somewhere in the range from deep processing, leading to an average of anywhere from 3.32 to 6.28 more words being recalled over shallow processing.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p184"><p>Just as with the one-sample <em>t</em> test, there are three aspects of the confidence interval to pay attention to: (1) whether it captures zero; (2) how close it is to zero; and (3) how wide it is:</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="nl-first" id="corty3e-ch8-p185"><p>If the confidence interval captures zero, then it is plausible that no difference exists between the two population means. Thus, a confidence interval that captures zero occurs when the researcher has failed to reject the null hypothesis, as long as he or she is using a two-tailed test with α = .05 <em>and</em> as long as he or she is calculating a 95% confidence interval.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-mid" id="corty3e-ch8-p186"><p>When the confidence interval comes close to zero, then it is possible that there is little difference between the two population means. When it ranges farther away from zero, then it is possible that the difference between the two populations is more meaningful. In this way, a confidence interval is helpful in thinking about the size of the effect.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-last" id="corty3e-ch8-p187"><p>The width of the confidence interval tells how precisely a researcher can specify the effect in the population. A narrower confidence interval means the researcher can be reasonably certain of the size and meaningfulness of the difference. A wider confidence interval leaves the researcher uncertain of the size and meaningfulness of the difference. In such a situation, it is often reasonable to recommend replicating the study with a larger sample size in order to obtain more precision.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p188"><p>Dr. Villanova’s confidence interval ranges from 3.32 to 6.28 for the depth of processing study. With regard to the three points above: (1) The confidence interval doesn’t capture zero. It is unlikely that there is no difference between the two population means. Dr. Villanova expected this result as the null hypothesis had been rejected. (2) The low end of the confidence interval, the end that is closer to zero, is 3.32. In Dr. Villanova’s opinion, a difference of 3.32 words is still a meaningful difference. Dr. Villanova, who planned and conducted this study, has expertise in this area and with this dependent variable. As a result, his opinion carries some weight. (3) The width of a confidence interval can be calculated by subtracting one side from the other:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="corty3e-ch8-p189"><p>6.28 – 3.32 = 2.96</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p190"><p>The confidence interval is almost three words wide. In Dr. Villanova’s opinion, based on his expertise, this is a reasonably narrow confidence interval. Thus, it provides a precise-enough estimate of what the population difference is. He feels little need to replicate with a larger sample size to obtain a narrower confidence interval.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx1-ans" id="corty3e-ch8-p192"><p><strong>A</strong> <em>d</em> and <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> are officially called effect sizes, but a confidence interval also gives information about how strong the effect of the explanatory variable is. <em>d</em> and <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> reflect the size of the effect as observed in the actual sample; a confidence interval extrapolates the effect to the population. Cohen’s <em>d</em> is not affected by sample size. If the group means and standard deviations stay the same but the sample size increases, <em>d</em> will be unchanged, but the confidence interval will narrow and offer a more precise estimate of the population value. <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> is inversely affected by sample size—as <em>N</em> increases, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> decreases.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p198"><p>There’s one more very important thing Dr. Villanova does. He did a lot of calculations—<em>t</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>, and a confidence interval—in order to understand the results. But, he doesn’t feel obligated to report them all just because he calculated them. He limits what he reports in order to give a clear and concise report:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch8-p199"><p>This study compared how deep processing of words vs. shallow processing of words affected recall on an unexpected memory test. The deep processing group (<em>M</em> = 8.30 words, <em>s</em> = 2.74 words) recalled more words than the shallow processing group (<em>M</em> = 3.50 words, <em>s</em> = 1.54 words). This effect was statistically significant [<em>t</em>(36) = 6.58, <em>p</em> &lt; .01 (one-tailed)] and it is a large effect. Using deep processing leads to markedly better recall when a person is not trying to memorize the words. Whether the effect exists when a person is purposefully trying to learn a list of words should be examined in a subsequent study.</p></div>

So, the possibility that there is zero difference between the two population means—walking speed on cold days vs. walking speed on warm days—is plausible.

It tells Dr. Risen that comparing the walking speed of the population of warm-day pedestrians to the population of cold-day pedestrians, the difference may be from 0.05 mph <em>slower</em> on cold days to 0.35 mph <em>faster</em> on cold days. In other words, from this study she can’t tell if, how much, or in what direction the two populations differ.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p223"><p>But, the confidence interval raises the possibility that the null hypothesis is false and pedestrians walk about a third of a mile per hour faster on cold days. In the language of hypothesis testing, she is worried about Type II error, that there may be an effect of temperature on walking speed that she failed to find. To ease her concern, she’s going to recommend replicating the study with a larger sample size. This would increase power, making it easier to reject the null hypothesis if it should be rejected, and it would give a narrower confidence interval.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch8-p225"><p>This study was conducted to see if temperature affected the pace of life in a city. The walking speed of pedestrians was measured on a cold day (20°F) and on a warm day (72°F). The mean speed on the cold day was 3.05 mph; on the warm day it was 2.90 mph. The difference in speed between the two days was not statistically significant [<em>t</em>(59) = 1.50, <em>p</em> &gt; .05]. These results do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that temperature affects the pace of urban life. However, the confidence interval for the difference between population means raised the possibility that there might be a small effect of temperature on walking speed. Therefore, replication of this study with a larger sample size is recommended.</p></div>

<h3 data-type="title" data-for_type="box" data-title-for="corty3e-ch8-bx5-1">Application Demonstration</h3>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch8-p226"><p>One of the most famous studies in psychology was conducted by Festinger and Carlsmith in 1959. In that study, they explored cognitive dissonance, a phenomenon whereby people change their attitudes to make attitudes consistent with behavior. Their study used an independent-samples <em>t</em> test to analyze the results. Let’s see what they did and then apply this book’s interpretative techniques to update Festinger’s and Carlsmith’s findings.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p227"><p>Festinger and Carlsmith brought male college students into a laboratory and asked them to perform very boring tasks. For example, one task involved a board with 48 pegs. The participant was asked to give each peg a one-quarter clockwise turn, and to keep doing this, peg after peg. After an hour of such boring activity, each participant was asked to help out by telling the next participant that the experiment was enjoyable and a lot of fun. In other words, the participants were asked to lie.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p228"><p>This is where the experimental manipulation took place: 20 participants were paid $1 for lying and 20 were paid $20 for lying. After helping out, each participant was then asked to rate how interesting he had actually found the experiment. The scale used ranged from –5 (extremely boring) to +5 (extremely interesting). Obviously, the participants should rate the experiment in the negative zone because it was quite boring.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_281"><p>281</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p229"><p>Did how much participants get paid influence their rating? It turned out that it did. The participants who were paid $1 gave a mean rating in the positive zone (+1.35), and the participants who were paid $20 gave a mean rating in the negative zone (–0.05). This difference was statistically significant [<em>t</em>(38) = 2.22, <em>p</em> &lt; .05]. The participants paid less to lie gave statistically significantly higher ratings about their level of interest in the study.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p230"><p>The researchers used cognitive dissonance to explain the results. The participants who had been paid $20 ($160 in 2015 dollars) had a ready explanation for why they had lied to the next participant—they had been well paid to do so. The participants who had been paid $1 had no such easy explanation. The $1 participants, in the researchers’ view, had thoughts like this in their minds: “The task was very boring, but I just told someone it was fun. I wouldn’t lie for a dollar, so the task must have been more fun than I thought it was.” They reduced the dissonance between their attitude and behavior by changing their attitude and rating the experiment more positively. Festinger’s and Carlsmith’s final sentence in the study was, “The results strongly corroborate the theory that was tested.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p231"><p>Statistical standards were different 60 years ago. Festinger and Carlsmith reported the results of the <em>t</em> test, but they didn’t report an effect size or a confidence interval. Fortunately, it is possible to take some of their results and work backward to find that <img id="" src="asset/ch8/corty3e_ineqn08_281_01.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image"> and <img id="" src="asset/ch8/corty3e_ineqn08_281_02.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image">. Armed with these values, an effect size and a confidence interval can be calculated.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p232"><p>First, here are the calculations for both effect sizes:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="equation" id="corty3e-ch8-eqn-26"><p>

<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch8-p233"><p>Now, here are the calculations for the confidence interval:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="equation" id="corty3e-ch8-eqn-27"><p>
<img id="" src="asset/ch8/corty3e_eqn08_282_01.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image"></p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch8-p234"><p>= (1.35 – (–0.05)) ± (2.024 × 0.63)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch8-p235"><p>= 1.4000 ± 1.2751</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch8-p236"><p>= from 0.1249 to 2.6751</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch8-p237"><p>= [0.12, 2.68]</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p238"><p>From <em>d</em> and <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>, it is apparent that the effect size falls in the medium range. From the confidence interval, one could conclude that though an effect exists, it could be a small one. Based on this study, it would be reasonable to conclude that cognitive dissonance has an effect. But, how much of an effect isn’t clear. Cognitive dissonance has gone on to be a well-accepted phenomenon in psychology. However, if this early cognitive dissonance study were being reported by a twenty-first-century researcher, he or she shouldn’t say that the results “strongly corroborated” the theory.</p></div>
