<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch6-p35"><p>Let’s put the 10 facts about hypothesis testing to work. Let’s suppose a psychologist, Dr. Pell, wonders whether children who are adopted differ in intelligence from nonadopted children. To explore this, she obtains a random sample of 72 children from the population of adopted children in the United States and gives each of them an IQ test. She finds that the mean IQ of these 72 children is 104.5. Knowing that the average IQ for children in the United States is 100 with a standard deviation of 15, can she conclude that adopted kids differ in intelligence from the general population?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_183"><p>183</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p36"><p>It is tempting to say that the answer is obvious. 104.5 is a bigger number than 100, so it is true that adopted kids differ from the general population of kids. But, that’s not how statisticians think.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p37"><p>Remember sampling error, introduced in <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch05.xml">Chapter 5</span>? Because of sampling error, researchers don’t expect a sample mean to be exactly the same as the population mean. With a population mean for IQ of 100, Dr. Pell can expect the sample mean to be close to 100, but not exactly 100.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p38"><p>So, here’s the question for Dr. Pell to ask: Is 104.5 close enough to 100 that sampling error can explain it? If so, then there’s no reason to think adopted kids differ from the average IQ. However, if sampling error fails as a reasonable explanation for the difference, then she can conclude that adopted kids differ in intelligence.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch6-p48"><p>The first step in hypothesis testing is picking which test to use. There are hundreds of statistical tests, each designed for a specific purpose. Choosing the correct test depends on a variety of factors such as the question being asked, the type of study being done, and the level of measurement of the data. In <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch16.xml">Chapter 16</span>, there are flowcharts that guide one through choosing the correct hypothesis test. Feel free to peek ahead and take a look at them.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="h4-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch6-p49"><p><span data-block_type="h4-N-ri1"><strong>Step 2</strong></span> <span data-block_type="SR-X-h4-T-ri"><strong>Check the Assumptions</strong></span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch6-p50"><p>All statistical tests have assumptions, conditions that need to be met before a test is completed. If the assumptions aren’t met, then researchers can’t be sure what the results of the test mean.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p51"><p>Here’s a nonstatistics explanation about the role of assumptions. In this day and age, athletes are tested for performance-enhancing substances. The drug test depends on a number of assumptions. For the test to be meaningful, it is assumed that the sample being tested is the athlete’s, that the sample was stored at the right temperature after it was taken, that no one has tampered with the sample, and that the machine being used to test it is correctly calibrated.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p52"><p>Imagine that an athlete wins a race, provides a urine sample, and it is tested on an incorrectly calibrated machine. The assumption that the machine is calibrated correctly has been violated. Suppose the results indicate that the urine does not test positive for performance-enhancing substances. Is that true? Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. When an assumption is violated, it is still physically possible to complete the test. But, one should not because it is impossible to interpret the results.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p53"><p>As hypothesis tests are covered, their assumptions will be listed to make sure one knows the conditions that must be met to proceed with the test. There are two types of assumptions: <em>not robust</em> and <em>robust.</em> A <span data-type="termref" data-term="nonrobust assumption">nonrobust assumption</span> has to be met for the test to proceed. If a nonrobust assumption is violated, a researcher should stop proceeding with the planned statistical test. A <span data-type="termref" data-term="robust assumption">robust assumption</span> can be violated, to some degree, and the test can still be completed and interpreted.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p54"><p>Here is a way to think about the difference between the two assumptions. People can be described as being in “robust” health or not. Imagine that Carl is not in robust health––he has a compromised immune system. In fact, his health is so bad that he is in an isolation ward in the hospital. One day he gets a visitor who has the flu and who sneezes while in the room. Carl, whose health has just been violated, is likely to get the flu. In contrast, Bethany is in robust health. One day her roommate, who has the flu, sneezes directly in her face. Bethany, with a strong immune system, is able to fight off this violation and stay healthy. However, there is a limit to what Bethany's immune system can handle. If one roommate with the flu sneezes in her face, by mistake Bethany uses the toothbrush of another roommate with the flu, and it turns out that Bethany's significant other—whom she spends a lot of time kissing—also has the flu, well, that may be too many violations for her immune system to handle. Even a robust assumption will break if it is violated too much.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch6-p56"><p>Step 3 involves listing the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. Hypotheses can be for <em>two-tailed tests</em> (also called nondirectional tests) or <em>one-tailed tests</em> (directional tests). A <span data-type="termref" data-term="two-tailed hypothesis test">two-tailed hypothesis test</span> doesn’t indicate whether the explanatory variable (adoption in our example) has a positive or negative impact on the outcome variable (IQ), just that it has an impact. An advantage of a two-tailed test is that it allows a researcher to test for an effect in either direction, that children who are adopted end up as more intelligent than average or as less intelligent than average. Two-tailed tests are the norm and are used much more frequently than one-tailed tests.</p></div>

One-tailed tests predict that the results will turn out in a certain direction. An advantage to using one-tailed tests is that it is easier to reject the null hypothesis and be forced to accept the alternative hypothesis.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p58"><p>With the current example, it seems reasonable to think a one-tailed test is called for because it is already known that the mean IQ of this sample of adopted children is above average. But the question—do adopted children differ in intelligence from the average—was formulated before any data were collected. The question doesn’t specify a direction for the difference, so a two-tailed test is called for. Changing the question after looking at the data is not how statisticians operate.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch6-p60"><p>Setting the decision rule involves finding the <em>critical value</em> of the test statistic. The <span data-type="termref" data-term="critical value">critical value</span> is the value that the test statistic must meet or exceed in order to reject the null hypothesis. What the critical value is depends on a number of factors, such as how willing the researcher is to draw the wrong conclusion and how many cases there are.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch6-p61"><p>Just as it is not fair to change from a two-tailed test to a one-tailed test after looking at the results, the decision rule is made in advance. That way, if the results are just short of the point where the null hypothesis is rejected, the researcher won’t be tempted to slide the critical value over a bit to get the results he or she desires.</p></div>

In future chapters, more interpretation questions will be added and the questions will change slightly from hypothesis test to hypothesis test. When there are multiple questions, they build on each other, so a researcher gains a greater understanding of the results. It is possible to stop after any question with enough information to offer an interpretation, but the more questions answered, the better a researcher will understand the results.</p></div>

In the IQ example, the sample was a random sample from the population of adopted children.

This assumption means that the scores of cases in the sample aren’t influenced by other cases in the sample. In the IQ example, the participants were randomly sampled, each case was in the sample only once, and each case was tested individually, so this assumption was not violated. This is not a robust assumption, so if the cases were not independent, we would not be able to proceed with the test.</p></div>

The psychic selected 81 people whom he believed had abnormal blood pressure. Their systolic blood pressures were measured (<em>M</em> = 127) and compared to the population mean (μ = 124) using a single-sample z test. No statistically significant difference was found (<em>z (N</em> = 81) = 1.50, <em>p</em> &gt; .05), indicating there was no evidence that this group of people selected for having high blood pressure had above-average blood pressure. Based on these data, there is not enough evidence to suggest that this psychic has any ability to read blood pressure. Though the results from this study seem conclusive, if one wanted to test this psychic’s ability again, it would be advisable to use a larger sample size.</p></div>
