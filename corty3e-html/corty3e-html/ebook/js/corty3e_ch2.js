xBookUtils.terms['apparent limits'] = '<strong>apparent limits</strong> what seem to be the upper and lower bounds of an interval in a grouped frequency distribution.';
xBookUtils.terms['bar graph'] = '<strong>bar graph</strong> a graph of a frequency distribution for discrete data that uses the heights of bars to indicate frequency; the bars do not touch.';
xBookUtils.terms['continuous numbers'] = '<strong>continuous numbers</strong> answer the question &#8220;how much&#8221; and can have &#8220;in-between&#8221; values; the specificity of the number, the number of decimal places reported, depends on the precision of the measuring instrument.';
xBookUtils.terms['cumulative frequency'] = '<strong>cumulative frequency</strong> a count of how often a given value, or a lower value, occurs in a set of data.';
xBookUtils.terms['cumulative percentage'] = '<strong>cumulative percentage</strong> cumulative frequency expressed as a percentage of the number of cases in the data set.';
xBookUtils.terms['discrete numbers'] = '<strong>discrete numbers</strong> answer the question &#8220;how many,&#8221; take whole number values, and have no &#8220;in-between&#8221; values.';
xBookUtils.terms['frequency distribution'] = '<strong>frequency distribution</strong> a tally of how often different values of a variable occur in a set of data.';
xBookUtils.terms['frequency polygon'] = '<strong>frequency polygon</strong> a frequency distribution for continuous data, displayed in graphical format, using a line connecting dots, above interval midpoints, that indicate frequency.';
xBookUtils.terms['grouped frequency distribution'] = '<strong>grouped frequency distribution</strong> a count of how often the values of a variable, grouped into intervals, occur in a set of data.';
xBookUtils.terms['histogram'] = '<strong>histogram</strong> a frequency distribution for continuous data, displayed in graph form, using the heights of bars to indicate frequency; the bars touch each other.';
xBookUtils.terms['kurtosis'] = '<strong>kurtosis</strong> how peaked or flat a frequency distribution is.';
xBookUtils.terms['midpoint'] = '<strong>midpoint</strong> the middle of an interval in a grouped frequency distribution.';
xBookUtils.terms['modality'] = '<strong>modality</strong> the number of peaks that exist in a frequency distribution.';
xBookUtils.terms['negative skew'] = '<strong>negative skew</strong> an asymmetrical frequency distribution in which the tail extends to the left, in the direction of lower scores.';
xBookUtils.terms['positive skew'] = '<strong>positive skew</strong> an asymmetrical frequency distribution in which the tail extends to the right, in the direction of higher scores.';
xBookUtils.terms['real limits'] = '<strong>real limits</strong> what are really the upper and lower bounds of a single continuous number or of an interval in a grouped frequency distribution.';
xBookUtils.terms['stem-and-leaf display'] = '<strong>stem-and-leaf display</strong> a data summary technique that combines features of a table and a graph.';
xBookUtils.terms['skewness'] = '<strong>skewness</strong> deviation from symmetry in a frequency distribution, which means the left and right sides of the distribution are not mirror images of each other.';
xBookUtils.terms['ungrouped frequency distribution'] = '<strong>ungrouped frequency distribution</strong> a count of how often each individual value of a variable occurs in a set of data.';
