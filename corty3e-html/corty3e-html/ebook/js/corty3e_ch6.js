xBookUtils.terms['alpha or alpha level'] = '<strong>alpha or alpha level</strong> the probability of making a Type I error; the probability that a result will fall in the rare zone and the null hypothesis will be rejected when the null hypothesis is true; often called significance level; abbreviated &#945;; usually set at .05 or 5&#37;.';
xBookUtils.terms['alternative hypothesis'] = '<strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> abbreviated <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>; a statement that the explanatory variable has an effect on the outcome variable in the population; usually, a statement of what the researcher believes to be true.';
xBookUtils.terms['beta'] = '<strong>beta</strong> the probability of making a Type II error; abbreviated &#946;.';
xBookUtils.terms['common zone'] = '<strong>common zone</strong> the section of the sampling distribution of a test statistic in which the observed outcome should fall if the null hypothesis is true; typically, 95&#37; of the sampling distribution.';
xBookUtils.terms['critical value'] = '<strong>critical value</strong> the value of the test statistic that forms the boundary between the rare zone and the common zone of sampling distribution of the test statistic.';
xBookUtils.terms['hypothesis'] = '<strong>hypothesis</strong> a proposed explanation for observed facts; a statement or prediction about a population value.';
xBookUtils.terms['hypothesis testing'] = '<strong>hypothesis testing</strong> a statistical procedure in which data from a sample are used to evaluate a hypothesis about a population.';
xBookUtils.terms['nonrobust assumption'] = '<strong>nonrobust assumption</strong> an assumption for a statistical test that must be met in order to proceed with the test.';
xBookUtils.terms['null hypothesis'] = '<strong>null hypothesis</strong> abbreviated <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>; a statement that in the population the explanatory variable has no impact on the outcome variable.';
xBookUtils.terms['one-tailed hypothesis test'] = '<strong>one-tailed hypothesis test</strong> hypothesis that predicts the explanatory variable has an impact on the outcome variable in a specific direction.';
xBookUtils.terms['p value'] = '<strong><em>p</em> value</strong> the probability of Type I error; the same as alpha level or significance level.';
xBookUtils.terms['power'] = '<strong>power</strong> the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis should be rejected.';
xBookUtils.terms['rare zone'] = '<strong>rare zone</strong> the section of the sampling distribution of a test statistic in which it is unlikely an observed outcome will fall if the null hypothesis is true; typically, 5&#37; of the sampling distribution.';
xBookUtils.terms['robust assumption'] = '<strong>robust assumption</strong> an assumption for a statistical test that can be violated to some degree and it is still OK to proceed with the test.';
xBookUtils.terms['significance level'] = '<strong>significance level</strong> the probability of Type I error; the same as alpha level or <em>p</em> value.';
xBookUtils.terms['statistically significant'] = '<strong>statistically significant</strong> when a researcher concludes that the observed sample results are different from the null-hypothesized population value.';
xBookUtils.terms['two-tailed hypothesis test'] = '<strong>two-tailed hypothesis test</strong> hypothesis that predicts the explanatory variable has an impact on the outcome variable but doesn&#8217;t predict the direction of the impact.';
xBookUtils.terms['Type I error'] = '<strong>Type I error</strong> the error that occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected; <em>p</em>(Type I error) &#61; &#945;.';
xBookUtils.terms['Type II error'] = '<strong>Type II error</strong> the error that occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis but should have rejected it; <em>p</em>(Type II error) &#61; &#946;.';
