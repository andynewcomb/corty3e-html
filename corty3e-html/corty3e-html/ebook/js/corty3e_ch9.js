xBookUtils.terms['paired-samples t test'] = '<strong>paired-samples t test</strong> hypothesis test used to compare the means of two dependent samples; also known as dependent-samples <em>t</em> test, correlated-samples <em>t</em> test, related-samples <em>t</em> test, matched-pairs <em>t</em> test, within-subjects <em>t</em> test, or repeated-measures <em>t</em> test.';
xBookUtils.terms['practical significance (or clinical significance)'] = '<strong>practical significance (or clinical significance)</strong> the size of the effect is large enough to say the independent variable has a meaningful impact on the dependent variable (or the clinical outcome).';
