// key terms
xBookUtils.terms['least squares criterion'] = '<strong>least squares criterion</strong> prediction errors are squared and the best-fitting regression line is the one that has the smallest sum of squared errors.';
xBookUtils.terms['linear regression'] = '<strong>linear regression</strong> a predictor variable is used to predict a case&#8217;s score on another variable and the prediction equation takes the form of a straight line.';
xBookUtils.terms['multiple linear regression'] = '<strong>multiple linear regression</strong> prediction in which multiple predictor variables are combined to predict an outcome variable.';
xBookUtils.terms['prediction interval'] = '<strong>prediction interval</strong> a range around <em>Y&#8242;</em> within which there is some certainty that a case&#8217;s real value of <em>Y</em> falls.';
xBookUtils.terms['regression line'] = '<strong>regression line</strong> the best-fitting straight line for predicting <em>Y</em> from <em>X.</em>';
xBookUtils.terms['residual'] = '<strong>residual</strong> the difference between an actual score and a predicted score; the size of the error in prediction.';
xBookUtils.terms['simple linear regression'] = '<strong>simple linear regression</strong> prediction in which <em>Y&#8242;</em> is predicted from a single predictor variable.';
xBookUtils.terms['slope'] = '<strong>slope</strong> the tilt of the line; rise over run; how much up or down change in <em>Y</em> is predicted for each 1-unit change in <em>X.</em>';
xBookUtils.terms['standard error of the estimate'] = '<strong>standard error of the estimate</strong> the standard deviation of the residual scores, a measure of error in regression.';
xBookUtils.terms['Y-intercept'] = '<strong>Y-intercept</strong> the spot where the regression line would pass through the <em>Y</em>-axis.';
xBookUtils.terms['Y prime'] = '<strong>Y prime</strong> the value of <em>Y</em> predicted from <em>X</em> by a regression equation; <em>Y&#8242;</em><em>.</em>';
