// key terms
xBookUtils.terms['central tendency'] = '<strong>central tendency</strong> a value used to summarize a set of scores; also known as the average.';
xBookUtils.terms['deviation score'] = '<strong>deviation score</strong> a measure of how far a score falls from the mean, calculated by subtracting the mean from the score.';
xBookUtils.terms['interquartile range'] = '<strong>interquartile range</strong> a measure of variability for interval- or ratio-level data; the distance covered by the middle 50&#37; of scores; abbreviated <em>IQR.</em>';
xBookUtils.terms['mean'] = '<strong>mean</strong> an average calculated for interval- or ratio-level data by summing all the values in a data set and dividing by the number of cases; abbreviated <em>M.</em>';
xBookUtils.terms['median'] = '<strong>median</strong> an average calculated by finding the score associated with the middle case, the case that separates the top half of scores from the bottom half; abbreviated <em>Mdn</em>; can be calculated for ordinal-, interval-, or ratio-level data.';
