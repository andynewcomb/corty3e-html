He wondered if people get most of their cavities when they are young or if they occur consistently over time. To investigate this, he decided to examine the relationship between the ages of his patients and how many of their permanent teeth were decayed, filled, or missing. What test should he use?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="cr_x_nl" id="corty3e-ch16-p181"><p><span data-block_type="question_num">16.40</span> An anti-doping agency decided to investigate if an athlete’s eliteness was related to the likelihood of doping. It unexpectedly drug-tested the top 10 finishers in all the track and field events at a large meet. From this, it calculated the percentage of first-place finishers who tested positive, the percentage of second-place finishers who tested positive, and so on. The agency then wanted to examine the relationship between the place in which an athlete finished and the likelihood of testing positive. What test should the agency use?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="cr_x_nl" id="corty3e-ch16-p182"><p><span data-block_type="question_num">16.41</span> A member of a bicycle club wondered if a relationship existed between how expensive a person’s bicycle was and how fast that person rode. He found riders with bikes in two categories. One group rode bikes that were classified by a cycling magazine as “decent bikes for not too much money.” The others rode bikes classified as “amazing, but even Bill Gates would think twice about spending this much for a bike.” The club member then asked each person to ride solo on a track and time his or her fastest lap. What test should the club member use to see if there’s a relationship between the cost of the bike and the speed of the rider?</p></div>

Cats are generally thought of as more independent and aloof. A personality psychologist wondered if a relationship existed between the personality trait of introversion/extroversion and the type of pet a person preferred. He obtained a sample of cat owners and a sample of dog owners. Each pet owner took a personality test and was classified as an introvert or an extrovert. What statistical test should be used to see if the two variables are related?</p></div>

<div data-block_type="cr_x_nl" id="corty3e-ch16-p186"><p><span data-block_type="question_num">16.43</span> A neonatologist is curious to find out what the long-term effect of premature birth is on mental development. He goes to a large school district, assembles a sample of sixth graders, and determines each student’s IQ score. From each student’s parents, he finds out if the student was full-term or premature at birth. What statistical test should he complete to figure out if there is a relationship between prematurity and IQ?</p></div>

<div data-block_type="cr_x_nl" id="corty3e-ch16-p189"><p><span data-block_type="question_num">16.46</span> A health-care researcher obtained a sample of respondents from throughout the United States and asked each one to indicate how worried he or she is about the avian flu on an interval-level scale. Before reporting the results for how worried Americans are about avian flu, the researcher wants to make sure the sample may be representative of the United States in terms of geographic distribution, based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s division of the United States into four regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). What statistical test should he use to answer this question?</p></div>

To test this, she gathered a sample of medical students in their final year and determined their GPAs. She also administered to each student the Differential Diagnosis Test (DDT). The DDT presents students with 50 diagnostic dilemmas. Each dilemma is considered equivalent, and scores on the DDT can range from 0 (no questions answered correctly) to 50 (all answered correctly). What statistical test should the dean use to answer her question?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="cr_x_nl" id="corty3e-ch16-p191"><p><span data-block_type="question_num">16.48</span> Graduates of a particular college were classified as having (a) liberal arts degrees or (b) professional degrees. They were also classified as (1) planning to pursue graduate education or (2) not going on for graduate education. When the graduates returned for their 25th reunion, they completed an interval-level, life satisfaction scale. Is life satisfaction influenced by type of degree and/or graduate study?

<div data-block_type="cr_x_nl" id="corty3e-ch16-p192"><p><span data-block_type="question_num">16.49</span> A sample of students at a college were asked to classify themselves as (1) Asian; (2) Black; (3) Hispanic; (4) Native American; (5) White; or (6) other. Each person was also asked whether his or her family would consider it acceptable (yes or no) if he or she married someone from a different racial category. What statistical test should be used to see if the degree of acceptability differs among racial/ethnic categories?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="cr_x_nl" id="corty3e-ch16-p193"><p><span data-block_type="question_num">16.50</span> The very last question in this book is a challenging one. It is rare that a researcher does a study that involves just one statistical analysis. Usually, there are multiple dependent variables and a branching series of questions and analyses. Here is an example. An infectious disease specialist believes she has developed a vaccine for the common cold. In order to test its efficacy, she designs a study. As a first step, potential participants call in and provide demographic information (age, sex, race) and complete an interval-level measure of general physical health. After this, they learn more about the study, and about 40% of those who originally called decide that they wish to take part in the study.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="cr-x-nl-txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p194"><p>The actual study is a double-blind study in which the volunteers will be inoculated either with the active vaccine or a placebo. At the end of the first week, each participant completes a side effect checklist, which counts how many side effects each person has experienced.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="cr-x-nl-txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p195"><p>For the next 12 months, the research team will keep track of each participant and whether he or she contracts a cold. If a participant contracts a cold, the research team will note how many days have elapsed from the vaccine until the cold. In addition, the researchers will assess the severity of the cold in terms of two dimensions: (1) measuring how many days the cold lasts, and (2) having the cold sufferers report how congested they felt on an ordinal scale.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="cr-x-nl-txt" id="corty3e-ch16-p196"><p>For each scenario below, decide which statistical test or tests should be used to answer the research question. Be aware—many of these questions involve multiple dependent variables and multiple analyses<strong>.</strong></p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx3-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch16-p204"><p>SPSS, like most serious software programs, has a variety of help options. One help option is Statistics Coach, which leads users through a series of questions to the selection of a statistical test. Let’s see how it works, using as an example the study in which the effect of early parental loss is measured years later in adults. There were four independent samples (no loss, mother died, father died, both died), and the dependent variable was measured at the interval level.</p></div>
