<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p11"><p>The <span data-type="termref" data-term="single-sample t test">single-sample <em>t</em> test</span> is used to compare a sample mean to a specific value like a population mean. As it deals with means, it is used when the dependent variable is measured at the interval or ratio level. It does the same thing as a single-sample <em>z</em> test, but it is more commonly used because it doesn’t require knowing the population standard deviation, σ. Instead, the single-sample <em>t</em> test uses the sample standard deviation, <em>s.</em> As long as there is access to the sample, it is possible to calculate <em>s.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p12"><p>For an example, imagine the following scenario. Dr. Farshad, a clinical psychologist, wondered whether adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) had reflexes that differed in speed from those of the general population. She located a test for reaction time that was normed on adults in the United States. The average reaction time was 200 milliseconds (msec). This is a population mean, so the Greek letter mu is used to represent it and one would write μ = 200.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p13"><p>From the various ADHD treatment centers in her home state of Illinois, Dr. Farshad obtained a random sample of 141 adults who had been diagnosed with ADHD. Each adult was tested individually on the reaction-time test. The mean reaction time for the <em>sample</em> of 141 was 220 msec (<em>M</em> = 220), with a standard deviation of 27 msec (<em>s</em> = 27). (Note that because these are values calculated from a sample, the abbreviations for the mean and standard deviation are Roman, not Greek, letters.)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p14"><p>Dr. Farshad’s question is whether adults with ADHD differ in reaction time from the general population. 220 msec is definitely different from 200 msec, so the mean reaction time of this sample of adults with ADHD is different from the population mean. However, Dr. Farshad doesn’t know if the difference is a statistically significant one! It’s possible that the sample mean is different from the population mean due to sampling error. To answer her question, she’s going to need hypothesis testing.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p15"><p>Let’s follow Dr. Farshad through the six steps of hypothesis testing for the single-sample <em>t</em> test: (1) picking a <em>test;</em> (2) checking the <em>assumptions;</em> (3) listing the <em>hypotheses;</em> (4) setting the <em>decision rule;</em> (5) <em>calculating</em> the test statistic; and (6) <em>interpreting</em> the results.

<div data-block_type="h4" id="corty3e-ch7-p16"><p><span data-block_type="h4-n-ri"><strong>Step 1</strong></span> <strong>Pick a Test</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p17"><p>The first step in hypothesis testing involves selecting the appropriate statistical test. Dr. Farshad is comparing the mean of a sample to the mean of a population, so she could use either a single-sample <em>z</em> test or a single-sample <em>t</em> test. However, she doesn’t know the population standard deviation. She’ll have to use the single-sample <em>t</em> test to figure out whether the mean reaction time of the sample of adults with ADHD is statistically different from the mean reaction time of the general population.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="h4" id="corty3e-ch7-p18"><p><span data-block_type="h4-n-ri"><strong>Step 2</strong></span> <strong>Check the Assumptions</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p19"><p>To determine if the sample mean is statistically different from the population mean, Dr. Farshad plans to use a single-sample <em>t</em> test. However, a single-sample <em>t</em> test can only be used if its assumptions are met. The three assumptions for the single-sample <em>t</em> test are the same as they were for the single-sample <em>z</em> test and are listed in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch7-fig-2"><strong>Table 7.1</strong></span>.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_217"><p>217</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p20"><p>The first assumption involves whether the sample is a random sample from the population. This is a robust assumption. So if it is violated—and it often is—the analysis can still be completed. One just has to be careful about the population to which one generalizes the results. In this example, the sample is a random sample from the population of adults with ADHD in one state. This means that Dr. Farshad should only generalize her results to that state.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p21"><p>The second assumption is that the observations within the sample are independent. This assumption is not robust. If it is violated, one cannot proceed with the single-sample <em>t</em> test. In this example, each participant is in the sample only once and the reaction time of each case is not influenced by any other case. The cases were selected randomly and tested individually, so they are independent and the second assumption is not violated.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p22"><p>The third assumption is that the dependent variable, reaction time, is normally distributed in the population. This assumption is robust and the analysis can be completed if the assumption is violated as long as the sample size is large, say, 30 or more, and the deviation from normality is not too large. How does one test this assumption? One way is simply assuming that it is true—it is generally accepted that psychological characteristics (like personality) and physical characteristics (like height) are normally distributed. So, Dr. Farshad is willing to assume that reaction time is normally distributed. Another way is to make a graph of the data. In <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch7-fig-3"><strong>Figure 7.1</strong></span>, the histogram that Dr. Farshad made for the frequency distribution of the reaction-time data can be seen. Though not perfectly normal, it has a normal-ish shape. That, combined with a large sample size, leads Dr. Farshad to feel sure that this assumption has not been violated.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx1-que" id="corty3e-ch7-p23"><p><strong>Q</strong> Why does the normality assumption exist?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-ans" id="corty3e-ch7-p24"><p><strong>A</strong> Hypothesis testing works by comparing the calculated value of the statistic to the expected value. The expected value comes from the sampling distribution, so the normality assumption is really about the shape of the sampling distribution. We know from the central limit theorem that the sampling distribution of the mean will be normal if <em>N</em> is large. If <em>N</em> is small, the sampling distribution will be normal if the population from which the samples are drawn is normal. And that is why the normality assumption exists.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p27"><p>Before writing the hypotheses, the researcher has to know if he or she is doing a one-tailed test or a two-tailed test. Two-tailed tests, called nondirectional tests, are more commonly used and they are a bit more conservative, in the sense that they make it harder to reject the null hypothesis. So, a two-tailed test is the “default” option—if in doubt, choose to do a two-tailed test. But, here’s the difference between the two types of tests:</p></div>
<ul data-block_type="bullet" id="corty3e-ch7-list-2">
<li><div data-block_type="bl-first" id="corty3e-ch7-p28"><p>A two-tailed test is used when the researcher is testing for a difference in either direction. Before collecting her data, Dr. Farshad didn’t know whether adults with ADHD had faster or slower reaction times. This calls for a nondirectional test and nondirectional hypotheses.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-last" id="corty3e-ch7-p29"><p>A one-tailed test is used when the researcher has a prediction about the direction of the difference <em>in advance</em> of collecting the data. As long as the difference is in the expected direction, a one-tailed test makes it easier to obtain statistically significant results.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p30"><p>The hypotheses for the nondirectional (two-tailed) single-sample <em>t</em> test for Dr. Farshad’s study are</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p31"><p><em>H</em><sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>ADHD-Adults</sub> = 200</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p32"><p><em>H</em><sub>1</sub>: μ<sub>ADHD-Adults</sub> ≠ 200</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p33"><p>The null hypothesis (<em>H</em><sub>0</sub>) says that the mean reaction time for the population of adults with ADHD is <em>not</em> different from some specified value. In this case, that value is the mean reaction time, 200 msec, of Americans in general. (The null hypothesis could be phrased as μ<sub>ADHD-Adults</sub> = μ<sub>Americans</sub> = 200.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p34"><p>The alternative hypothesis (<em>H</em><sub>1</sub>) says that the mean reaction time for the population of adults with ADHD is something other than the specified value of 200 msec. It doesn’t say whether it is faster or slower, just that the mean reaction time is different. This means that the observed sample mean should be different enough from 200 msec that sampling error does not explain the difference. (The alternative hypothesis could be phrased as μ<sub>ADHD-Adults</sub> ≠ μ<sub>Americans</sub>.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_219"><p>219</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p35"><p>If Dr. Farshad had believed that adults with ADHD had, for example, slower reaction times than the general population, then she would have planned a one-tailed test. In such a situation, the hypotheses would have been</p></div>

<div data-block_type="eq" id="corty3e-ch7-p37"><p><em>H</em><sub>1</sub>: μ<sub>ADHD-Adults</sub> &gt; 200</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p38"><p>Never forget that the alternative hypothesis expresses what the researcher believes to be true and that the researcher wants to be forced to reject the null hypothesis, so he or she has to accept the alternative hypothesis. In this one-tailed test example, the researcher’s belief is that the reaction time is longer (i.e., slower) for people with ADHD. Once the alternative hypothesis is formed, the null hypothesis is written to make both hypotheses all-inclusive and mutually exclusive. Here, the null hypothesis would be that people with ADHD have reaction times the same as or faster than those of the general population.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="h4" id="corty3e-ch7-p39"><p><span data-block_type="h4-n-ri"><strong>Step 4</strong></span> <strong>Set the Decision Rule</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p40"><p>Setting the decision rule involves determining when to reject the null hypothesis and when to fail to reject the null hypothesis. To set the decision rule, find the critical value of the test statistic, the boundary between the rare zone and the common zone of the sampling distribution. For the single-sample <em>t</em> test, this will be a critical value of <em>t.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p41"><p>What is <em>t</em>? <em>t</em> is the statistic that is calculated in the next step of the six-step hypothesis test procedure. The statistic <em>t</em> is a lot like the statistic <em>z</em> in the single-sample <em>z</em> test:</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p45"><p>The point that separates “differs enough from zero” from “doesn’t differ enough from zero” is called the <span data-type="termref" data-term="critical value of t">critical value of <em>t</em></span>, abbreviated <em>t<sub>cv</sub>.</em> To find <em>t<sub>cv</sub>,</em> three pieces of information are needed:</p></div>
<ol data-block_type="numbered" id="corty3e-ch7-list-4">
<li><div data-block_type="nl-first" id="corty3e-ch7-p46"><p>Is the test one-tailed or two-tailed?</p></div>

</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-last" id="corty3e-ch7-p48"><p>How large is the sample size?</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p49"><p>The first question, whether a one-tailed or a two-tailed test is being done, was already answered when writing the hypotheses. Dr. Farshad is examining whether adults with ADHD have faster <em>or</em> slower reaction times than the general population. The reaction-time study calls for a two-tailed test because the hypotheses didn’t specify a direction for the difference.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p50"><p>The second question in determining <em>t<sub>cv</sub></em> involves how willing one is to make a Type I error. A Type I error occurs when the researcher concludes, mistakenly, that the null hypothesis should be rejected. A common convention in statistics is to choose to have no more than a 5% chance of making a Type I error. As alpha (α) is the probability of a Type I error, statisticians phrase this as “setting alpha at .05” or as “α = .05.” Dr. Farshad has chosen to follow convention and set alpha at .05.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_220"><p>220</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p51"><p>Overall, she wants her chance of making a Type I error to be no more than 5%. She has chosen to do a two-tailed test, so she will need to split that 5% in two and put 2.5% in each tail of the sampling distribution. This means Dr. Farshad will have two critical values of <em>t,</em> one positive and one negative. (If the test were one-tailed, all 5% of the rare zone would fall on one side and there would be only one critical value of <em>t.</em>)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p52"><p>The third question for determining <em>t<sub>cv</sub>,</em> how large the sample size is, matters because the shape of the <em>t</em> distribution changes as the sample size changes. The tail of a <em>t</em> distribution is larger when the sample size is smaller. As a result, the critical value of <em>t</em> is farther away from zero when the sample size is small.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p53"><p>This is difficult to visualize without a concrete example, so look at <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch7-fig-4"><strong>Figure 7.2</strong></span> in which two sampling distributions of <em>t</em> are superimposed—one for <em>N</em> = 6 (the dotted line) and one for <em>N</em> = 60 (the solid line). Which line is on top—the dotted line or the solid line—depends on whether one is looking at the center of the distribution or the tails.</p></div>

<span data-type="number">Figure 7.3: </span><span data-type="caption"><strong><span data-block_type="fig_num">Figure 7.2</span> Shape of Sampling Distribution of <em>t</em> as a Function of Sample Size</strong> This figure shows how the shape of the sampling distribution of <em>t</em> changes with the sample size. When the sample size is small, there is more variability and more samples have means that fall farther out in a tail. As a result, the critical value of <em>t</em> falls farther away from the midpoint when the sample size is small, making it more difficult to reject the null hypothesis.</span>
</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p54"><p>Look at the tails. There, the dotted line (the one for the <em>t</em> distribution when <em>N</em> = 6) is above the solid line for the <em>t</em> distribution when <em>N</em> = 60. What does it mean for one line to be on top of the other? The <em>y</em>-axis measures frequency, so when one line is above another, this means it has a higher frequency at that point.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p55"><p>Focus on the positive side, the right-hand side, of the distribution. (Because the <em>t</em> distribution is symmetric, both sides are the same.) Note that around <em>t</em> = 1.5, the two lines cross. From that point on, the frequencies at each <em>t</em> value are higher for the <em>N</em> = 6 distribution than for the <em>N</em> = 60 distribution. Which distribution has more cases with <em>t</em> values above 1.50, <em>N</em> = 6 or <em>N</em> = 60? The answer is that the <em>N</em> = 6 distribution has a higher percentage of cases in the tail.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p56"><p>The implication of this is important: the total frequency of scores in the tail is higher for the distribution with the smaller sample size (<em>N</em> = 6). To cut off the extreme 2.5% of the scores for each distribution, the cut-off point will fall farther away from zero for the <em>N</em> = 6 distribution than for the <em>N</em> = 60 distribution. In this example, the cut-off points (the critical values of <em>t</em>) are 2.57 for <em>N</em> = 6 and 2.00 for <em>N</em> = 60. The critical value falls closer to zero when the sample size is larger, and it falls farther away from zero when the sample size is smaller.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p57"><p>Sample size affects the critical value of <em>t,</em> and the critical value determines the rare and common zones in the sampling distribution. (Remember, when a result falls in the rare zone, the null hypothesis is rejected; when a result falls in the common zone, the null hypothesis is not rejected.) So, sample size affects the ability to reject the null hypothesis:</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="bl-first" id="corty3e-ch7-p58"><p>When the sample size is small, the critical value of <em>t</em> falls farther away from zero, making the rare zone harder to reach, making it more difficult to reject the null hypothesis.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="bl-last" id="corty3e-ch7-p59"><p>Larger sample sizes have the opposite effect. When a sample size is large, the critical value of <em>t</em> falls closer to zero. As a result, the rare zone is easier to reach, which makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis.</p></div>

If one case has a score of 9 and another case has a score of 11, then the third case has to have a score of 10. In that example, there are three values, and 2 degrees of freedom—once two values are known, the third is determined.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-ex-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch7-p97"><p>Adjusting to the first year of college can be hard, especially if something traumatic happens back at home. A veterinarian in an imaginary college town, Dr. Richman, wondered if the GPA went down for students who lost a family pet while they were away at college. The vet found 11 students at the college who indicated that their pets at home had died during the year. He had each student report his or her GPA for the year and found the mean was 2.58, with a standard deviation of 0.50. From the college registrar, Dr. Richman learned that the mean GPA for all students for the year was 2.68. Thus, <em>M</em> = 2.58 and μ = 2.68. Does losing a pet have a negative impact on GPA?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p98"><p>The answer appears to be yes, because the sample of students who have lost a pet has a GPA lower than the population’s GPA. But, isn’t it possible, due to sampling error, that a random sample of 11 people from a population where μ = 2.68 could have a sample mean of 2.58? The vet is going to need hypothesis testing to determine if the difference between the sample and the population is statistically significant.</p></div>

The sample is not a random sample from the population because all participants self-selected and come from only one college. It is possible that the students who lost pets and who chose not to participate differed in some way from those who volunteered. So, the first assumption is violated. Luckily, the first assumption is robust and can be violated, though Dr. Richman will need to be careful about generalizing from the results.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p101"><p>There’s no reason to believe that the second assumption is violated. The observations seem to be independent.

And each participant was in the sample only once.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch7-p102"><p>The third assumption is not violated because Dr. Richman is willing to assume that GPA, like intelligence, is normally distributed.
