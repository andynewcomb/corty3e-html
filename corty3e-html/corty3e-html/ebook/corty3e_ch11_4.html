It is in the sixth step of hypothesis testing, the interpretation of results, that clear language is used to tell what was found and what it means. In the ADHD/level of distraction study, for example, repeated-measures ANOVA is being used to determine if treatment decreases the level of distraction and if the improvement is maintained when treatment stops.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch11-p215"><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of individual behavior therapy in treating children with ADHD. Four children with ADHD had their levels of distraction assessed before treatment started (<em>M</em> = 22.25), at the end of treatment (<em>M</em> = 15.00), and again six months later (<em>M</em> = 18.75). Using a one-way, repeated-measures ANOVA, there was a large and statistically significant effect on distractibility as a function of when the outcome was assessed [<em>F</em>(2, 6) = 18.72, <em>p</em> &lt; .01]. Post-hoc tests showed that the mean level of distraction significantly improved from pre-treatment to the end of treatment. Unfortunately, a statistically significant amount of relapse occurred over the next six months, with the mean distractibility level getting worse from the end of treatment to the six-month follow-up. The change in the mean level of distraction from pre-treatment to six-month follow-up was not statistically significant, meaning there was insufficient evidence to show that ADHD symptoms were any better six months after treatment than they were before treatment started. Individual behavior therapy appears effective in treating ADHD, but the results don’t remain fully in effect for six months when treatment is over. However, the present study only had four participants and it is possible that the small sample size prevented some effects from being found. To get a better sense of the long-term impact of individual behavior therapy on distractibility, the study should be replicated with a larger sample size.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-ex-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch11-p216"><p>For practice interpreting a one-way, repeated-measures ANOVA, let’s use the results from the back pain surgery study. In that study, Dr. Agosto, an orthopedic surgeon, took 30 people with chronic back pain and divided them into groups of three that were matched on age, sex, years of pain, and degree of impairment. One of the three people in each group was randomly assigned to receive real surgery, one sham surgery, and one no surgery. Each participant then received physical therapy for six months, at which point his or her quality of life was measured (with higher scores indicating better functioning). The mean was 51.00 for the 10 surgery patients, 48.00 for the sham surgery patients, and 45.00 for the physical therapy only patients. <em>F<sub>cv</sub></em> was 3.555 and the ANOVA summary table for the one-way, repeated-measures ANOVA is presented here again as <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch11-fig-24"><strong>Table 11.7</strong></span>.</p></div>

By isolating the variability due to treatment from variability due to individual differences, it is easier to reject the null hypothesis with a repeated-measures design.

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch11-p246"><p>I conducted a study investigating how effective surgery is as a treatment for chronic back pain. Thirty people with chronic back pain were matched into groups of three on the basis of age, sex, length of illness, and severity of illness. One member of each group was randomly assigned to receive real surgery, one to receive sham surgery, and one to receive no surgery. Each participant then received six months of physical therapy. Using a one-way, repeated-measures ANOVA, there was a small to modest, statistically significant effect for type of treatment on quality of life [<em>F</em>(2, 18) = 31.91, <em>p</em> &lt; .05]. People receiving real surgery had a statistically higher quality of life (<em>M</em> = 51.00) than people receiving sham surgery (<em>M</em> = 48.00), and people receiving sham surgery had a statistically better quality of life than people just receiving physical therapy (<em>M</em> = 45.00). These results show that though there is a placebo effect for having surgery for back pain, there is a benefit to receiving surgery that is above and beyond the placebo effect. Future research should investigate which types of back problems are helped by which type of treatment.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch11-p252"><p>In the most famous example of classical conditioning, a conditioned stimulus (a bell) was repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (meat) until a dog learned to salivate to the sound of the bell. Salivation to the bell is called a conditioned response. The process of then teaching the dog <em>not</em> to salivate to the bell is called extinction. In extinction, the dog hears the bell but doesn’t see the meat and eventually the bell no longer elicits salivation. If a researcher then waits a few days after extinction has occurred and rings the bell around the dog again, the dog will salivate to the sound of the bell again. This is called spontaneous recovery.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch11-p253"><p>Let’s imagine a researcher who wanted to see if extinction and spontaneous recovery occurred in humans with naturally occurring classical conditioning.

(Try this thought experiment: Think of someone cutting open a juicy yellow lemon, right in front of you. You watch as she takes a slice of lemon, bites into it, and grimaces a little at the sourness of it. Just thinking of this, do you feel salivation happening in your mouth? That’s a conditioned response.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch11-p255"><p>Dr. Brian brought 35 participants from the experiment participation pool into his lab, one at a time, and measured how many grams of saliva each one produced in 2 minutes (as a baseline). How is salivation measured? Weigh some cotton balls, put them in a mouth for 2 minutes, and then weigh them again. The gain in weight reflects the amount of salivation.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch11-p256"><p>After this, Dr. Brian had the participants smell a lemon for a 2-minute period, during which salivation was measured again. This was the first extinction trial. There was then a 3-minute break, after which the second extinction trial occurred (sniffing a lemon but not tasting it). This continued for seven more extinction trials. Salivation during extinction wasn’t measured again until the tenth (and last) extinction trial. The next day, participants came back to the lab and, for the last time, sniffed a lemon for 2 minutes while salivation was measured. This was the spontaneous recovery trial.</p></div>

This did not concern Dr. Brian much, because repeated-measures ANOVA is robust to violations of this assumption and because he has no reason to believe that the response of these participants to a lemon would be much different from anyone else’s response to a lemon. The other two assumptions, independence of observations and normality, were not violated. So, Dr. Brian can proceed.</p></div>

In order to find the critical value of <em>F,</em> <em>F<sub>cv</sub>,</em> Dr. Brian has to decide how willing he is to make a Type I error.

In such a situation, the row with the degrees of freedom that is closest without going over is used. (Remember, this is called <em>The Price Is Right</em> rule.) This is the row with 100 degrees of freedom. <em>F<sub>cv</sub></em> = 2.696 with α = .05. The decision rule is:</p></div>

The observed <em>F</em> ratio of 8.71 is greater than or equal to the critical value of <em>F,</em> 2.696, so the null hypothesis is rejected. The alternative hypothesis is accepted—it is probably true that at least one of the population means differs from at least one other population mean. Dr. Brian knows that there is a difference in the level of salivation between at least two of these conditions: baseline, the first extinction trial, the last extinction trial, or the spontaneous recovery trial. There may be more than two means that differ. To learn which mean or means differ will have to await post-hoc tests. For now, though, Dr. Brian can write the results in APA format:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch11-p286"><p><em>How big is the effect?</em> The second interpretation question for one-way, repeated-measures ANOVA is answered by using <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch11-bx6-2">Equation 11.2</span> to calculate η<sup>2</sup>. Eta squared provides information about how much of the variability in the amount of salivation is explained by the four different conditions (baseline, first extinction trial, last extinction trial, and spontaneous recovery trial). Below are the calculations, resulting in η<sup>2</sup> = 5.51%. Following Cohen’s guidelines, Dr. Brian considers explaining 5.51% of the effect in salivation by the treatment condition to be a small to medium effect:</p></div>

With four groups, there are six possible comparisons, as shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch11-fig-31"><strong>Table 11.9</strong></span>. In fact, arranging the comparisons this way is very helpful for a researcher thinking about the results, because different comparisons address different questions.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="sr_x_nl_first" id="corty3e-ch11-p289"><p>Is there a conditioned response of salivation to the sight and smell of a lemon? This is addressed by Comparison 1, which compares baseline salivation to the first time the participants smelled a lemon, which was the first extinction trial.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_408"><p>408</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sr_x_nl_first" id="corty3e-ch11-p290"><p>Does extinction occur? This question is broken down into two subquestions. Is there a decrease in salivation from the first extinction trial to the last extinction trial (Comparison 4)? If there is a decrease in salivation, does it go all the way back to baseline levels (Comparison 2)?</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sr_x_nl_first" id="corty3e-ch11-p291"><p>Does spontaneous recovery occur? This also has two subquestions. Is there more salivation on the spontaneous recovery trial than at the last extinction trial (Comparison 6)? If so, does the increase go all the way back to the level of salivation at the first extinction trial (Comparison 5)?</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch11-p292"><p>Note that Comparison 3 is not mentioned. Dr. Brian is not interested in comparing the amount of spontaneous recovery salivation to baseline salivation, so he’ll ignore it.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch11-p293"><p>In order to complete the comparisons he has planned, Dr. Brian needs to find the <em>HSD</em> value for the Tukey post-hoc test. The first step in using <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch11-bx6-3">Equation 11.3</span> is to find the <em>q</em> value in <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e_app1_1.html#corty3e-app1-fig-18">Appendix Table 5</span>. With <em>k</em> = 4 and <em>df</em><sub>Residual</sub> = 102, <em>q</em> = 3.74. (Note that <em>The Price Is Right</em> rule was applied.) After he retrieves <em>MS</em><sub>Residual</sub> = 0.24 from the ANOVA summary table (<span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch11-fig-29">Table 11.8</span>) and notes that as he had 35 participants <em>n</em> = 35, he can complete <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch11-bx6-3">Equation 11.3</span>:</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="sr_x_nl_first" id="corty3e-ch11-p295"><p>Is there a conditioned response of salivation to the sight and smell of a lemon? Yes. Smelling a lemon causes a statistically significant increase in mean salivation from baseline.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sr_x_nl_first" id="corty3e-ch11-p296"><p>Does extinction occur? Yes. There is a statistically significant decrease in mean salivation from the first extinction trial to the last. In fact, by the last extinction trial, the mean amount of salivation can’t be differentiated from baseline salivation, suggesting that extinction was complete. (This is one of the rare instances where nonsignificant results are informative.)</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sr_x_nl_first" id="corty3e-ch11-p297"><p>Does spontaneous recovery occur? There is not much evidence for spontaneous recovery. There is not statistically significantly more salivation at the spontaneous recovery trial than there was on the last extinction trial.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch11-p298"><p><em>Putting it all together.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch11-p299"><p>This study investigated whether humans show a naturally occurring response of salivation to the smell of a lemon and whether such a conditioned response can be extinguished and then spontaneously recovered. Thirty-five volunteers measured their baseline salivation and then had 10 extinction trials during which they held and smelled a lemon. Amount of salivation to a lemon was measured on the first and last extinction trials and again, at a spontaneous recovery trial, 24 hours later.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch11-p300"><p>There were statistically significant differences among the means <em>F</em> (3, 102) = 8.71, <em>p &lt;</em> .05. Post-hoc tests showed that there was a naturally occurring response of salivation to the sight/smell of a lemon and that this response could be extinguished. In this way a naturally occurring conditioned response behaves like an experimentally induced conditioned response. However, the naturally occurring conditioned response did not behave like an experimentally induced conditioned response in terms of spontaneous recovery. Whether naturally occurring conditioned responses really don’t show spontaneous recovery, or not a long enough period of time was given for spontaneous recovery is a fruitful area for future research.</p></div>
