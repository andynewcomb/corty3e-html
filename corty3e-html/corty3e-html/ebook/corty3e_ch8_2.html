<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch8-p13"><p><span data-type="termref" data-term="two-sample t test">Two-sample <em>t</em> tests</span> are used to compare the mean of one population to the mean of another population. To conduct a two-sample <em>t</em> test, a researcher needs two samples of cases and an interval- or ratio-level dependent variable. Many experiments in psychology follow this format. For example, a group of researchers was interested in seeing how stereotypes affect behavior (Bargh, Chen, &amp; Burrows, 1996). They divided undergraduate students into two groups, a control group and an experimental group. Both groups were given words that they had to put into sentences. The control group received neutral words and the experimental group was given words like <em>Florida,</em> <em>wrinkle,</em> and <em>forgetful</em>—words that were meant to prime a stereotype of elderly people. When the participants thought the experiment was over, they exited through a hallway and the experimenters secretly timed how long each person took to walk down the hall. The experimenters believed that being primed with words that are associated with the elderly would lead participants to act like elderly people and walk more slowly.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_258"><p>258</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p14"><p>The results showed that the control group walked down a 30-foot hall, on average, 1 second faster than the experimental group. One second does not sound like much of a difference, but when the experimenters analyzed the data using a two-sample <em>t</em> test, they found that the difference was a statistically significant one.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p15"><p>The difference meant that by the time an average person in the control group reached the end of the hall, an average person in the experimental group wasn’t yet 90% of the way down the hall (<strong><span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch08.xml#corty3e-ch8-fig-2">Figure 8.1</span></strong>). The experimental group averaged 2.6 mph compared to 2.9 mph in the control group. Being primed with an elderly stereotype did lead participants to act more like elderly people and a two-sample <em>t</em> test helped the researchers reach this conclusion.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p16"><p>There are two different types of two-sample <em>t</em> tests, the independent-samples <em>t</em> test (the focus of this chapter) and the paired-samples <em>t</em> test (see <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch09.xml">Chapter 9</span>). Obviously, they differ in terms of the samples being analyzed, whether the samples are independent or paired. What’s the difference between <em>independent samples</em> and <em>paired samples</em>?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p17"><p>With <span data-type="termref" data-term="independent samples">independent samples</span><strong>,</strong> how cases are selected for one sample has no influence on (<em>is independent of</em>) the case selection for the other sample. Each sample could be a random sample from its population. With <span data-type="termref" data-term="paired samples">paired samples</span>, often called dependent samples, the cases selected for one sample are connected to (<em>depend on</em>) the cases in the other sample. The cases in the samples are pairs of cases, yoked together in some way.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p18"><p>To clarify the difference between independent samples and paired samples, here is an example of two different ways to compare the intelligence of men and women to see which sex is smarter:</p></div>
<ol data-block_type="numbered" id="corty3e-ch8-list-2">
<li><div data-block_type="nl-first" id="corty3e-ch8-p19"><p>Dr. Smith obtains a random sample of men from the population of men in the world and a random sample of women from the population of women. Each person in the samples takes an IQ test, and Dr. Smith compares the mean of the men to the mean of the women.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-last" id="corty3e-ch8-p20"><p>Dr. Jones gets a random sample of married heterosexual couples. Each man and each woman takes an IQ test, and Dr. Jones compares the mean of the men to the mean of the women.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p21"><p>In the first example, the cases selected for one group have no influence on the cases selected for the other group, so that is an example of independent samples. In the second scenario, who the women are is dependent on the men, so that is an example of paired samples.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch8-p22"><p>It is important to know if the two samples being analyzed are independent or paired so that the researcher can choose the right two-sample test. The example above is one way that subjects can be paired. <strong><span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch08.xml#corty3e-ch8-fig-3">Table 8.1</span></strong> contains some guidelines for determining if subjects are paired.</p></div>
