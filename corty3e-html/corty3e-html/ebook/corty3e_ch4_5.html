To understand why probability is important, consider a study in which a sample of people with depression is divided into two groups, one of which is given psychotherapy and the other isn’t. After treatment, the two groups are assessed on a depression scale and the psychotherapy participants are found to be less depressed than the no-psychotherapy participants.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p205"><p>Coins are often used to teach probability. A coin has two possible outcomes, heads or tails, and they are <em>mutually exclusive.</em> This means the coin can only land heads or tails—not both—on a given toss. (<em>Fairness,</em> that each outcome is equally likely, is going to be assumed for all examples.) Applying <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-bx6-4">Equation 4.4</span>, if the coin has two possible outcomes, heads or tails, and there is only one way it can land heads, the probability of it landing heads is <em>p</em>(heads) = <img id="" src="asset/ch4/corty3e_ineqn04_129_01.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image">.

<li><div data-block_type="bl-last" id="corty3e-ch4-p208"><p>Finally, by multiplying the proportion by 100, the probability can be turned into a percentage: .50 × 100 = 50. One could say, “There is a 50% chance that a coin will land heads.”</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p217"><p>The most common way that statisticians calculate and use probability involves the normal distribution. They often ask, if a variable is normally distributed and a case is selected at random from a population, how likely is it—how probable is it—that this case would have a score that falls in a certain range?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p218"><p>The material covered in <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e_ch4_3.html">Section 4.2</span> of this chapter can be construed in just this way. For example, if 50% of cases fall at or above the mean, then the probability of a case selected at random having a score at or above the mean is .50. If approximately 84% of the cases fall in the region at or below a <em>z</em> score of 1, then the probability of picking a case at random and it having a <em>z</em> score less than or equal to 1 is .84. (To move from a percentage to a probability, move the decimal two places to the left; to move from a probability to a percentage, move the decimal place two spots to the right.)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p219"><p>Statisticians use probabilities to determine if a result is common or rare. By <em>common,</em> they mean the result occurs frequently, that it falls somewhere near the middle of a normal distribution. Typically, statisticians consider something that has a 95% chance of occurring as common. A <em>rare</em> result is one that is unlikely to occur, one that falls in the ends, the tails, of the distribution. As will be seen in <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e-ch06.xml">Chapter 6</span>, how rare something must be to be considered rare is a decision that should be made on an experiment-by-experiment basis. But, usually, statisticians consider something rare if it has a 5% or less chance of occurring. Phrased in terms of probability, if <em>p&lt;</em>.05, it is usually considered a rare outcome to a statistician.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p220"><p>Let’s find the <em>z</em> scores that mark off the middle 95% of scores in a normal distribution. This will lead us to one of the most important numbers in statistics, 1.96.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p221"><p>Follow the procedure in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-fig-33"><strong>Table 4.4</strong></span> to find the <em>z</em> scores that mark off the middle 95% of cases.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p222"><p>Why split it in two? Because that tells us how much of the area is above the mean and how much is below it. We now know that the 95% consists of 47.5% (half) above the mean and 47.5% (the other half) below the mean.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p223"><p>The second step is to look in column B of <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e_app1_1.html#corty3e-app1-fig-1">Appendix Table 1</span> to find the value closest to this percentage. Column B contains the exact value of 47.50, and the <em>z</em> score associated with it is 1.96. The final step in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-fig-33">Table 4.4</span> is to report the results as a range from a negative <em>z</em> score to a positive <em>z</em> score: in a normal distribution, the middle 95% of cases fall from a <em>z</em> score of –1.96 to a <em>z</em> score of 1.96 (see <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-fig-35"><strong>Figure 4.22</strong></span>). Or, thinking in terms of probability, if one took a case at random from the population, the probability is .95 that it came from the interval ranging from <em>z</em> = –1.96 to <em>z</em> = 1.96.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-ex-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p230"><p>Now, with a rough idea of what the answer was, he followed the guidelines in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-fig-33">Table 4.4</span> to find the exact answer. First, he cut the percentage in half. Then, he used column C of <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e_app1_1.html#corty3e-app1-fig-1">Appendix Table 1</span> to find the <em>z</em> score associated with the half percentage value. Looking in column C of <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e_app1_1.html#corty3e-app1-fig-1">Appendix Table 1</span>, he found that the value closest to 25% was 25.14 and the <em>z</em> score associated with it was 0.67. In <em>z</em> score format, he had his answer: below a <em>z</em> score of –0.67 <em>and</em> above a <em>z</em> score of 0.67, the extreme 50% of cases fall.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-ex-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p231"><p>But, to answer the original question, he needed to turn the <em>z</em> scores into IQ scores using <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-bx6-3">Equation 4.3</span>:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-exp-eq" id="corty3e-ch4-p232"><p><em>X</em> = 100 + (–0.67 × 15)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-exp-eq" id="corty3e-ch4-p236"><p>= 89.95</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-exp-eq" id="corty3e-ch4-p240"><p>= 110.05</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-ex-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch4-p241"><p>He now had his answer: The IQ scores that mark off the extreme 50% of scores are 89.95 and 110.05. He would need to follow the progress of students with IQs lower than 90 or higher than 110 to see how the new math curriculum affected the extreme 50% of students.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch4-p252"><p>Let’s use some historical data about IQ to see material from this chapter in action. In the past, intelligence was used as the sole criterion of whether a person was classified as having an intellectual disability or being gifted. These days, multiple criteria are used. Let’s see what the implications of the former criteria are, based on an IQ test with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p253"><p>Let’s start with intellectual disability. At one point, people were considered intellectually disabled if their IQs were less than 70. Now, adaptive behavior—the ability to function in everyday life—is also taken into account. But, using the old definition, if a person were picked at random, what is the probability that he or she would be classified as intellectually disabled?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p254"><p>An IQ score below 70 means an IQ score less than or equal to 69, so our question becomes, “What is the probability of having an IQ score ≤ 69?” It always helps to visualize what one is doing, so sketch out a normal distribution. <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-fig-37"><strong>Figure 4.24</strong></span> shows a normal distribution with the <em>X</em>-axis marked in both IQ scores and <em>z</em> scores. For the IQ scores, the midpoint is 100 and then the standard deviation is added or subtracted in both directions 3 times. Thus, the IQ scores range from 55 to 145. There is a dotted vertical line marking an IQ score of 69 and the area below the line, to the left of it, is shaded in. This is the area to be found. It should be apparent that this is not a large percentage of cases. In fact, it should be close to 2%.</p></div>

</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p255"><p>Now, it is time to calculate more exactly. Using <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-bx6-2">Equation 4.2</span>, convert the IQ score to a <em>z</em> score:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="equation" id="corty3e-ch4-eqn-10"><p>

<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p256"><p>An IQ score of 69 is equivalent to a <em>z</em> score of –2.07. (Remember, the fact that the <em>z</em> score is negative means that it falls below the mean.) Now, take that <em>z</em> score and find the percentage of cases at or below it. The flowchart in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-fig-19">Figure 4.12</span> directs one to column C of <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e_app1_1.html#corty3e-app1-fig-1">Appendix Table 1</span>. Turn to that table and find the row with a <em>z</em> score of 2.07. (Remember, the normal distribution is symmetrical, so one can consider 2.07 the same as –2.07.) The answer as a percentage, 1.92%, is found in column C. We can turn 1.92% into a probability of .0192 by moving the decimal place two places to the left. And that’s the answer—if a person were picked at random out of the world, the probability is .0192 that he or she would be classified as intellectually disabled if that classification were based entirely on IQ.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p257"><p>Here’s one more way to use this probability. If the population of the United States is 320 million, how many have IQs of 69 or lower? Answer this by taking the probability, .0192, and multiplying it by the population:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch4-p258"><p>.0192 × 320,000,000 = 6,144,000</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p259"><p>That’s a lot of people! Using the old standard, more than 6 million people in the United States should have IQs of 69 or lower and would be classified as intellectually disabled.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p260"><p>Let’s look at the other side of the intelligence continuum—genius. How common are geniuses? One cut-off for genius, on a standard IQ test (mean = 100 and standard deviation = 15), is a score of 145 or higher. This is sketched in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-fig-39"><strong>Figure 4.25</strong></span>. It should be apparent that this is the upper limit of the simplified version of the normal distribution. There are very few people with IQ scores of 145 or higher.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p261"><p>To find out what percentage of people could be classified as geniuses, use <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-bx6-2">Equation 4.2</span> to turn the IQ score into a <em>z</em> score:</p></div>

Reading across the row in the <em>z</em> score table for a <em>z</em> score of 3.00, one finds that the value in column C is 0.135%. And that’s the answer: assuming intelligence is normally distributed and considering anyone with an IQ of 145 or higher a genius, then 0.135% of the population will be geniuses.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p263"><p>What does that mean for the 320 million Americans? Turn 0.135% into a proportion (.00135) and multiply that by the population:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-eq" id="corty3e-ch4-p264"><p>.00135 × 320,000,000 = 432,000</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p265"><p>Fewer than half a million Americans, only 432,000 to be exact, should have IQs high enough to be classified as geniuses.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-x-txt" id="corty3e-ch4-p266"><p>One last thing, let’s suppose someone takes an IQ test and gets a 145. What’s his or her score as a percentile rank? The flowchart in <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch4-fig-26">Figure 4.18</span> says to consult column A of <span data-type="link" data-href="corty3e_app1_1.html#corty3e-app1-fig-1">Appendix Table 1</span>. Reading column A for a <em>z</em> score of 3.00, we see that the person’s score is 99.865, as a percentile rank. Not a bad percentile rank to have.</p></div>
