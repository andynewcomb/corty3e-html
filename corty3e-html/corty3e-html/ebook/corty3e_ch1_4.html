The numbers used for each category are arbitrary and provide no quantitative information. The numbers simply indicate whether two things are the same or different. Cases are assigned different numbers if they possess different qualities, and they are assigned the same number if they possess the same quality. For example, the race of participants in a study could be measured by assigning a 1 to whites, 2 to blacks, 3 to Native Americans, 4 to Asians, and 5 to Pacific Islanders. If Jack is a 1 and Jill is a 1, then both are white. If Simone is a 1 and Susanne is a 2, then they are of different races.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p98"><p>There is not much math that can be done with nominal numbers because the numbers are arbitrary. The researcher studying race could just as easily assign the number 7 to whites, 22 to blacks, 0.78 to Native Americans, and so on. The numbers are arbitrary, so it doesn’t make sense to find the “average” race of a group of people.

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch1-p100"><p><span data-type="termref" data-term="Ordinal-level numbers">Ordinal-level numbers</span> reveal whether cases possess more or less of some characteristic. In ordinal measurement, one might order the objects being measured from lowest to highest (or vice versa) in terms of how much of the characteristic each possesses. Then, ranks are assigned. For example, it is common to say that the person with the fastest time in a race came in first place, the next fastest person was in second place, and so on. Thus, ordinal numbers give information about the <em>direction</em> of differences, about which case possesses more or less of the attribute being measured.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p101"><p>But, ordinal numbers don’t give any information about how much distance separates cases with different ranks. For example, the most populous state in the United States is California, with about 39 million people. It is followed by Texas (27 million) and Florida (20 million). Note that the distance between rank 1 and 2 is 12 million people and the distance from rank 2 to 3 is 7 million people, yet both are one rank apart. Sometimes the distance between two adjacent scores is large, and sometimes it is small. Ordinal numbers give no information about how far apart cases are.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p102"><p>Though ordinal numbers are still limited in the math one can perform, there are special statistics developed to use with ordinal measures. Here are some ordinal variables psychologists use:</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="bl-first" id="corty3e-ch1-p103"><p>Class rank and birth order, two variables psychologists use, are ordinal. In fact, most variables with the term <em>rank</em> or <em>order</em> in them are ordinal.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="bl-mid" id="corty3e-ch1-p104"><p>Individual items on the Apgar scale, a way of measuring the health of newborns, are ordinal.

</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch1-p106"><p><span data-type="termref" data-term="Interval-level numbers">Interval-level numbers</span> tell <em>how much</em> of the characteristic being measured a case possesses. They contain meaningful information about <em>distance</em> between cases in addition to information about same/different and more/less. That is, they reveal how much of a difference exists between two cases.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p107"><p>Interval-level numbers can tell how far apart two cases are because there is equality of units. Equality of units means that the interval used on the scale is a consistent width along the whole length of the scale. For example, on a Fahrenheit temperature scale, the distance from 31° to 32° is the same as the distance from 211° to 212°.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p108"><p>If an attribute is measured on an interval scale, one can add and subtract the numbers, as well as calculate averages. However, one can’t divide a specific interval-level measure by another interval-level measure. For example, it is not legitimate to say that an 80° summer day is twice as warm as a 40° winter day. Proportions can’t be calculated because interval-level scales have arbitrary zero points. On an interval scale, a value of zero does not mean the absence of the attribute being measured. If a person takes a paper-and-pencil IQ test and answers all the questions incorrectly, one wouldn’t say that he or she has no intelligence. Similarly, if the outside temperature on a winter day is 0°F, shown in <strong><span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch1-fig-13">Figure 1.8</span></strong>, it would be silly to state that there is no temperature that day.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p109"><p>A lot of the variables that psychologists measure, factors like intelligence and personality, are interval-level numbers. Statisticians prefer interval-level numbers over ordinal-level numbers and nominal-level numbers because interval-level numbers contain more information and more math can be done on them. For example, as already mentioned, one can find an average for a variable measured on an interval scale. More statistical techniques have been developed for interval-level data than for nominal and ordinal data.</p></div>

Absolute zero indicates that a score of 0 means none of the attribute being measured is present. A simple example is speed. On a speed scale, such as miles per hour (mph), a value of zero means that the object is not moving. It has zero speed. An absolute zero point means one can divide two ratio-level numbers, to turn them into a proportion. If José is driving a car at 10 mph and Celeste is driving at 20 mph, one can legitimately say that her car is going twice as fast.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p111"><p>Most of the time, absolute zero points exist only for physical variables, not psychological ones. For example, height, weight, speed, and population all have absolute zero points. Also, things like age, cholesterol level, and pollution level have absolute zero points. There are some psychologically relevant variables—heart rate, crime rate, and length of marriage—that are ratio level. But, many other psychological variables—for instance, intelligence, masculinity, and conscientiousness—are not ratio level.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p112"><p>If a zero on a ratio scale means that none of the attribute is present, it seems like it would be impossible to have a negative ratio-level number.

<div data-block_type="sr-ex-txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch1-p117"><p>For practice figuring out level of measurement, imagine an end-of-semester test in an introductory psychology class that is meant to measure knowledge of psychology.

<div data-block_type="sr-ex-txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p118"><p>To figure out the problem, think of two students, with two different scores on the test, one with an 80 and one with a 90, as shown in <strong><span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch1-fig-17">Figure 1.11</span></strong>. The test scores tell same vs. different, 80 is different from 90, so this test is measuring knowledge of psychology at least at the nominal level. One can also tell the direction of the difference, that one student did better than the other (90 is more than 80), so this test is measuring at least at the ordinal level.

<div data-block_type="sr-ex-txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p119"><p>The final question is whether there is an absolute zero point. It was stated earlier that this test was meant to measure knowledge of psychology. If someone got a zero on the test, would that mean this person has zero knowledge of psychology? No! It would just mean that the person didn’t answer those 50 questions correctly. There might be 50 other facts that the person knows. That means this test has an arbitrary zero point, not an absolute one. As the last “yes” answer was at the interval level, one should stop there and conclude that this test measures knowledge of psychology at the interval level.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr-ex-txt" id="corty3e-ch1-p120"><p>However, be aware that there is room for disagreement. Someone else may use this test to measure how many of the 50 questions were answered correctly. In that case, the zero point is absolute and the test is measuring at the ratio-level variable.
