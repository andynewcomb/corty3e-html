<div data-block_type="fm-aau" id="corty3e-fm1-p98"><p><strong>ERIC W. CORTY</strong> has a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Vassar College, a doctorate in clinical psychology from Indiana University, and two postdoctoral fellowships, one in neuropsychopharmacology (University of Pennsylvania) and one in human sexuality (Case Western Reserve University). Since 1993, Corty has been a member of the psychology faculty at Penn State Erie, the Behrend College. There, he teaches principles of measurements, abnormal psychology, human sexuality, introductory psychology, and, of course, statistics. The quality of his teaching was recognized in 1997 when he received the Council of Fellows Excellence in Teaching Award and in 2001 when he became a Penn State Teaching Fellow. At present, Corty is the Interim Director of the School of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences at Penn State Behrend.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-aau" id="corty3e-fm1-p99"><p>Corty’s work has appeared in more than three dozen peer-reviewed publications. His research on ejaculatory latencies received worldwide attention, including being made fun of on the <em>Late Show with David Letterman</em>. His statistics textbook was recognized as Book of the Year by the <em>American Journal of Nursing</em> in 1997. Corty serves as a member of the editorial board for <em>The Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy</em> and previously was on the editorial board for <em>The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology</em>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-aau" id="corty3e-fm1-p100"><p>Corty was born in Wilmington, Delaware, and still celebrates Delaware Day every December 7th. He now lives in Beachwood, Ohio. He likes to eat and to cook, loves to ride his bicycles, and is sad to report that he has not made much progress on his pool game since the second edition.</p></div>
