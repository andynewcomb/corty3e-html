</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch10-p234"><p>The interpretation of a between-subjects, one-way ANOVA starts the same way it did for <em>t</em> tests, addressing questions of whether the null hypothesis was rejected and how big the effect is. After that, the interpretation answers a different question, where the effect is found.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch10-p235"><p>Why is there a need to worry about where the effect is? This question didn’t have to be addressed for a <em>t</em> test because in a <em>t</em> test just two groups exist. If the results of a <em>t</em> test were statistically significant, it was clear that the mean of Group 1 was different from the mean of Group 2. However, there can be more than two groups in an ANOVA. If the results of the ANOVA are statistically significant, then all that is known is that the mean of at least one group is different from at least one other group. If there are three groups, the mean of Group 1 could differ from the mean of Group 2, the mean of Group 1 could differ from the mean of Group 3, or the mean of Group 2 could differ from the mean of Group 3. It is also possible that two of the mean of the three pairs could differ or that all three pairs could differ. This is why it’s important to address the question of where the effect is when interpreting a statistically significant ANOVA.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch10-p236"><p>Dr. Chung’s maze study compared rats that expected to find different foods in the goal box of a maze. Ten rats were assigned to three groups—one that expected to find low-calorie food in the goal box, one that expected medium-calorie food, and one that expected high-calorie food. The rats expecting low-calorie food took 31 seconds from start box to goal box, the rats expecting medium-calorie food took 28 seconds, and the rats expecting high-calorie food took 25 seconds. Dr. Chung had determined <em>F<sub>cv</sub></em> = 4.737 and formulated the decision rule:</p></div>

Applying the decision rule, it is clear that 31.40 is greater than or equal to 4.737, and <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch10-fig-47"><strong>Figure 10.12</strong></span> shows how the observed value of <em>F</em> falls in the rare zone. This means that the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis accepted. This leads to the conclusion that at least one of the three groups—rats expecting low-calorie food, rats expecting medium-calorie food, or rats expecting high-calorie food—differs from at least one of the others in terms of the mean time it takes to get to the food. It is not yet clear where the difference lies, so the best interpretation Dr. Chung can make at present is: “The results of the between-subjects, one-way ANOVA were statistically significant [<em>F</em>(2, 7) = 31.40, <em>p</em> &lt; .05], indicating that there is a statistically significant difference in the time it takes to get from the start box to the goal box depending on the calorie content of the food a rat expects to find.”</p></div>

When all the rats are of the same age and from the same strain, as they were here, then the calorie content of the food in the goal box has a very large effect on the speed with which the animal travels the maze.

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="corty3e-ch10-p258"><p>So far, Dr. Chung knows that the goal affects running time and how much variability is explained, but he doesn’t know where the effect occurs.

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch10-p260"><p>The <em>F</em> ratio, which was statistically significant, reveals that at least one pair of means has a statistically significant difference, but it doesn’t tell which one or which ones. For that, a <em>post-hoc</em> test is needed. “Post-hoc” is Latin for “after this” and post-hoc tests are meant to be used only <em>after</em> a statistically significant <em>F</em> ratio has been found. Post-hoc tests are mathematically designed to allow multiple comparisons to be made while keeping alpha at the desired level.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch10-p261"><p>There are a wide variety of post-hoc tests with cool names like the Scheffé, the Newman-Keuls, and the Bonferroni-Dunn. Post-hoc tests vary in terms of what type of error they are more likely to make, a Type I error or a Type II error. No post-hoc test can guarantee avoiding a mistake. Compared to each other, some post-hoc tests are more likely to say that there is a statistically significant difference between means that don’t differ (Type I error). Other post-hoc tests are more likely to find no statistically significant difference when a difference exists (Type II error).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch10-p262"><p>The test taught here, the Tukey <em>HSD,</em> is the latter type, what is called a conservative test. If it finds a statistically significant difference between a pair of means, then the population means probably really are different. Which is why <em>HSD</em> stands for “honestly significant difference.” However, there is a cost to this conservatism: the <em>HSD</em> has less statistical power and so may overlook a pair of means that are different.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch10-p263"><p>The Tukey <em>HSD</em> works by calculating an <em>HSD</em> value, which is the minimum difference needed between two means in order for the difference to be considered statistically significant. If the observed difference between a pair of means is greater than or equal to the <em>HSD</em> value, then the researcher can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups. For example, the mean for the low-calorie group was 31 seconds and for the medium-calorie group it was 28 seconds. There is a 3.00-second difference between the mean of these two groups. If the <em>HSD</em> value were, say, 2.50, then the difference between the mean of these two groups would be a statistically significant one. This is the case because the observed difference, 3.00, met or exceeded the <em>HSD</em> value of 2.50.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch10-p286"><p>Once a researcher knows whether a difference is statistically significant, he or she needs to think about the direction of the difference.

</li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch10-p290"><p>A statistically significant ANOVA reveals that at least one pair of population means differs. Now after the post-hoc test, Dr. Chung knows which pairs differ and what the differences mean. His challenge is to summarize the findings. He could report that the mean of Group 1 differs from the mean of Group 2 and that the mean of Group 1 differs from the mean of Group 3, and so forth, but that would be a focus on the trees, not the forest. Interpretations are more useful if they find a pattern in the results. Dr. Chung’s findings could be summarized by saying that rats, this strain of rats at least, appear able to figure out that different foods have different caloric contents and, when hungry, are more motivated to seek nutritionally richer foods.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="corty3e-ch10-p291"><p>With all three interpretation questions addressed—Was the null hypothesis rejected? How big is the effect? Where is the effect?—Dr. Chung is ready to write a four-point interpretation that (1) tells what the study was about, (2) presents the main results, (3) explains what the results mean, and (4) makes suggestions for future research:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch10-p292"><p>In this study, rats were exposed to three different types of food (low-calorie, medium-calorie, and high-calorie) in the goal box while learning a maze. After learning the maze, they were made hungry, randomly assigned to three groups, and timed while they ran the maze. The three groups expected to find different foods in the goal box: low-calorie, medium-calorie, or high-calorie. There was a statistically significant decrease in mean time, that is, an increase in mean speed, as the caloric content of the food increased [<em>F</em>(2, 7) = 31.40, <em>p</em> &lt; .05]. Time decreased from a mean of 31.00 seconds for the rats expecting low-calorie food to 28.00 seconds for those expecting medium-calorie food and to 25.00 seconds for the ones expecting high-calorie food. The effect of caloric content on speed in this study was quite dramatic, accounting for 90% of the variability in speed. This is probably an overestimate of the effect of caloric content as all rats were from the same strain and were the same age.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="corty3e_page_362"><p>362</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch10-p293"><p>These results suggest that this strain of rats is able to discriminate the caloric content of food and that, when they are hungry, they are more motivated to seek nutritionally richer food. This motivation makes sense for increasing the likelihood of survival in lean times. An alternative explanation for the results is that the richer-calorie foods tasted better and that rats hurry to food if it tastes good. Future research should be sure to control for food taste. Future research should also employ different strains of rats.</p></div>

The participants who received placebos kept their hands in ice water for an average of 17.50 seconds, the ibuprofen participants for 23.00 seconds, and the acetaminophen participants for 21.00 seconds. <em>F<sub>cv</sub></em> was 4.256 and the ANOVA summary table is reprinted here (see <span data-type="link" data-href="#corty3e-ch10-fig-54"><strong>Table 10.13</strong></span>).</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="sr-exp-bl-first" id="corty3e-ch10-p304"><p>Not enough evidence exists to say there is an effect.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch10-p306"><p>One way to reconcile these two conflicting pieces of information is to look at the possibility of a Type II error. Type II errors occur when a researcher fails to find statistically significant evidence of an effect that really does exist. That possibility can’t be ruled out here. When interpreting such a situation, the researcher should point out the possibility and suggest that the study be replicated with a larger sample size. Larger sample sizes give tests more power and so increase the likelihood of being able to find an effect when it does exist.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch10-p307"><p><em>Where is the effect?</em> Post-hoc tests are designed to be conducted only when the null hypothesis is rejected. In this study, the null hypothesis was not rejected. This means there is not enough evidence that an effect exists, so there is no reason to try to find where the effect is.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt" id="corty3e-ch10-p308"><p><em>Putting it all together.</em> Here’s Dr. Douglas’s four-point interpretation for the pain threshold study.

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch10-p309"><p>Analysis of data for a study comparing the impact of placebo, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen on pain threshold found no evidence that either of the over-the-counter pain relievers had any impact on the threshold for perceiving pain. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean time it took participants to perceive pain when their hands were in ice water [<em>F</em>(2, 9) = 1.35, <em>p</em> &gt; .05]. There was some evidence that medication may have an impact, but the small sample size (<em>N</em> =12) meant the study did not have enough power to detect it. In order to determine if these over-the-counter pain relievers have an impact on pain threshold, the study should be replicated with a larger sample size.</p></div>

The largest mean is the Northeast at $77.73 thousand and the smallest is the South at $61.37 thousand. Those two are 16.36 points apart and this difference is a statistically significant difference. All other differences are smaller than 16.31 and thus not statistically significant. The effect seems to be due to the $16.36 thousand difference between the mean salaries for psychologists in the Northeast and mean salaries in the South. Salaries are statistically significantly higher in the Northeast than they are in the South.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="sr_exp_txt_v1_ni" id="corty3e-ch10-p356"><p>In this study, a random sample of states from each of the four census regions was taken and the average salary in each state for clinical, counseling, and school psychologists was recorded. The mean salary in the Northeast region was $77,730, $63,550 in the Midwest, $61,370 in the South, and $68,830 in the West. The overall ANOVA showed a statistically significant effect for the region [<em>F</em>(3, 12) = 3.52, <em>p</em> &lt; .05] and region accounted for almost 50% of the variability in salary. However, post-hoc testing showed that the only statistically significant difference that existed was between the Northeast and the South—the mean salaries for clinical, counseling, and school psychologists are statistically higher in the Northeast than in the South. The results of this study suggest that it might be worthwhile for a psychologist living in the South to move to the North, but there would be no advantage to moving to the West or Midwest. If this study is replicated, it would be advisable to take into account the cost of living as higher salaries in a region may be mitigated by a higher cost of living.</p></div>
